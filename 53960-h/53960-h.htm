<p class='pindent'>Mr. and Mrs. John Johnson Jones were commonplace
people, but like him who cried because there
were no more worlds to conquer, they were ambitious.
There was one sphere within whose sacred
precincts they could not enter, and they wanted—to
be fashionable. They looked around—they beheld
others, who, like themselves, had once been excluded
from the “land of promise,” and with a mighty resolution,
determined to die or conquer—to overthrow
the <span class='it'>chevaux-de-frise</span> surrounding Japonicadom, with
“the impudence of wealth;” and at length—at length
the charmed gates at which Mrs. Jones had sat in an
agony of despair, burst open to her delighted gaze,
and she rose in public estimation high as the frothy
pyramids with which she ornamented her expensive
suppers and baited her guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all, and in spite of the old copy that we have
written, about the root of all evil, money is a “great
invention;” especially here, where it bestows wit on
fools, beauty on beasts, and covering the blots on all
escutcheons, forces us to that promiscuous mingling
which out-democrats democracy. How magnanimous
it makes us! While the friends of the needy assist
them down the hill of fortune and bid them farewell,
they turn to help the lucky over its stepping stones,
and lifting the pedlar’s pack from his shoulders, rub
them down, and push him into what we call “our
first circle”. And a pretty circle it would be, were
the beginning known! But the shining gold that
glitters through a handsome purse, is the <span class='it'>passe partout</span>;
and like the princess in the fairy tale, nobody
looks behind for fear of hobgoblin discoveries of his
next door neighbor. Besides, reduced people are <span class='it'>so</span>
contemptible! Put them out! With each new reign
new peers arise, and so new houses should rear
their tops over the old ones, when the owners are
useless and the furniture tarnished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a generation as we are! Such an age of
refinement! Who would sit down in the year 1849,
to a dinner on a square-table! Who would touch any
but a Westphalia ham—drink champagne from a
narrow glass—take a cup of tea from any but a silver
urn—sit in any but a Louis Quatorze—kiss a baby
that wore corals—notice an acquaintance with a
last winter bonnet, or a <span class='it'>visite</span> instead of a Jenny
Lind? Dear me! dear me! I have been thinking a
long time, and don’t know anybody that would!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jones knew better for one—so did Mr. Jones;
and while they were as vulgar as pride and ignorance
could make them, learned to look upon themselves
as “glasses of fashion and moulds of form.” They
had to labor for the distinction with a zeal worthy a
better cause; and my readers shall have the benefit
of their attempts if they are not already too tired to
proceed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jones canvassed among her female acquaintances
for popularity, by calling, flattering, cringing,
and sending them delicacies made by her own fair
hands; and Mr. Jones, who was very anxious to be
“genteel,” studied Chesterfield, and wondered what
it meant. He belonged to one of the first families of
a state, in which all the families were first—a universal
right of distinction. His connections would
have been titled in an aristocracy; but their respect
for the American government made them condescend
to be plain Misters, Madams, and Misses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jones himself was a little finnikin man, with
sharp, black eyes, and high cheek bones, upon which
rested two red spots like the remains of a fly-blister.
He combed his hair into a stiff <span class='it'>toupet</span>, that made him
look like an inverted furniture-brush, with the usual
equivocal portrait of some very great individual
upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortune particularly distinguished Mr. Jones and
saved him the trial of an impossibility—the one of
distinguishing himself. She gave him the key to
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>
every door when she made him wealthy, and in pure
gratitude he converted his soul into a cent, and his
heart into hard specie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, Fortune bestowed on him the would-be-elegant
Miss Pushaw, as high-born as himself; and
he was certainly a happy man when he stood up with
a bride whose dress was, like Margaret Overreach’s,
“sprinkled o’er with gold.” He was soon dazzled
by her manœuvering qualities, and touched by the
congeniality of feeling which existed between them.
An adoration of fine clothes, fine furniture, and
fashionable people, was the sacred link that bound
these loving hearts into one; and upon their removal
from the country to the city, no marble-cutter labored
harder, or struck more small pieces right and left,
than did Mr. and Mrs. John Johnson Jones, when
they fawned and flattered, and ran small errands for
the neighbors that surrounded them, “the great
Athenians.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jones kept a small confectionary establishment
in her pantry, for all the ladies who fell sick;
and Mr. Jones was kind enough to open a cigar and
drinking establishment for the gentlemen who were
obliging enough to call. They progressed, however,
slowly in the affections of the proud ——ians, and
were somewhat discouraged, but recollecting the
pretty motto of “Hope on, hope ever,” they did not
despair, and contemplated taking larger strides toward
gentility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jones had been originally called Sally, but
changed the appellation for the softer one of Sara.
Spring came on, and she resolved to follow the
world of fashion to one of its favorite resorts, the
little village of Quiproquo. She persuaded her loving
spouse to rent one of its cottages; and covering some
old sofas and chairs with new chintz, furnished it
nicely and neatly enough to have satisfied the most
fastidious. But to every visiter the same apology
was made for its plainness; and Mrs. Jones informed
them all that “her house in town was furnished
<span class='it'>elegunt</span>, but she didn’t like to bring out her mahogany
cheers,” while her husband’s invariable rejoinder
was, “Why, Sara, there are plenty more where
them came from!” A mere playful allusion to the
amount of his fortune, a fact he never lost sight of,
and in time it had its due effect on his listeners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This house became at length the <span class='it'>pied-à-terre</span> for
all the high-bred loungers that had nothing to do but
smoke, drink, and play Boston in the summer months;
the season of inevitable idleness for all Southerners
of all professions—doctors excepted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jones talked very loud and very much <span class='it'>du
nez</span>; she took all the empty speeches she listened to
for witticisms, and was forever busy in the service
of others, running about shaking a little basket of
keys, to impress them with a due sense of her importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jones’s wine flowed freely, (so did his brandy
par parenthesis. Brandy-and-water drinking becomes
a solemn duty in the warm weather, among
the inhabitants of Quiproquo.) Then the boxes of
best Havanas were fast emptied, and clouds of smoke
arose from the front piazza, frightening the neighbors
into thinking the house was on fire until they
were used to it. And Boston! and whist! there was
no end to these favorite games, while the gossips of
the village whispered that it was a very profitable
amusement to Mr. Jones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was still a Mordecai at the gate of poor
Mrs. Jones’s soul. Many had called to see her,
whose nod a few months previous was as great as
Jove’s from Mount Olympus; but like all who strive
for much, she wanted more. There was one card
whose reception would at once stamp her “a peer,”
give her the right to place the golden grasshopper in
her hair; for Mrs. Macfuss was one of the proud
Autochthones whose boast was that she had never
been but the first among the first. She had been
heard to say that she could not think of encouraging
such persons as the Joneses! And such a speech
from the cynosure of all eyes threw Mrs. Jones
into hysterics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Macfuss’s house was the house par excellence;
her suppers were given in the Hall of Apollo, where
Lucullus supped with Lucullus. The dinners were
triumphs of culinary art, over which the very spirit
of Ude must have presided. Her toilette was ever in
the most exquisite taste. Her dresses gave the <span class='it'>ton</span>,
and her patronage decided the fate of a mantuamaker
for life. The entire race of milliners would have
credited her forever sooner than lose the honor of her
custom; and she it was for whose favor poor Mrs.
Jones pined in green and yellow melancholy. She
cried for very spite, while Mr. Jones swore that he
would trample on the d—n proud set after a while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They determined to make a mighty effort, and
commenced preparations for a ball. Invitations were
written on scented paper, and put into <a id='env'></a>envelopes with
embossed vines and bouquets over the seal. These
were sent to her new acquaintances, and the “picked
and chosen” of her old ones; and breaking through
the charmed rules of etiquette, Mrs. Jones’s cards
were slipped into some of the invitations and left at
Mrs. Macfuss’s for herself and family. A band of
music was engaged, and every thing prepared on a
large scale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jones was seen rushing in and out of the
house in an old loose gown looking like—herself;
sleeves up to her elbows, and said elbows covered
with eggs, sugar and butter; while behind her ran
Master Pushaw Jones, on a pair of hard fat, blue legs,
his face besmeared with the same sweet compound
that graced his mamma’s arms, enlivening the scene
with shrill screams for egg-shells, into which he concocted
sundry messes that defy description.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In every sunny spot around the house were tables
covered with cakes like pyramids of snow, so white
and smooth was the icing poured over them. In the
kitchen were fowls roasting and hams boiling;
turkeys innumerable in their tin houses, getting
basted and browned; and oysters getting plumped
and pickled, peppered and spiced. There was more
shuffling, running about, upsetting and breaking, than
can be imagined, and fussing, to Mrs. Jones’s content.
Baskets of champagne arriving from town;
blocks of ice; borrowed china and glass; lamps,
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span>
candelabras, &amp;c., &amp;c. Servants rushing out to assist
the draymen, shouting, tumbling over one another
in an agony of amazement at “Miss Sally’s importance,”
and ransacking drawers and closets for cup-towels
and tumbler-towels that were insufficient for
all the wiping that was to be done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The table was set out—and a magnificent one it
was, if profusion is beauty. There was nothing
wanting. Plenty of lights, too, were in readiness,
and nearly all was completed the evening before, to
poor Mrs. Jones’s relief. She went to bed, endeavoring
to think the fatigue a pleasure, and slept
soundly enough to feel recruited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, alas! a bad day and a worse night damped her
expectations, and she walked about, giving her directions
with less buoyancy than the evening previous.
<span class='it'>Then</span>, the fair moon was filling the earth with her
silver light, and covering the galleries (whereon
the guests were to have promenaded) with her radiance.
<span class='it'>Now</span>, the air was damp and chilly, the rain
was still dropping over the roof, and the roads were,
of course, almost impassable. The grandees shrugged
their shoulders at the idea of a wet drive to Mrs.
Jones’s party, and many who would have gone, remained
at home for want of comfortable equipages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The musicians called the quadrilles in hoarse
voices, and their instruments were out of tune. The
wind blew out the lights, and great confusion prevailed
among the dancers. The icing ran down the
sides of the cakes, the Charlotte Russes flowed over
and the beautiful jelly, so perfectly moulded, melted
away like a dream. Mrs. Jones was ready to swoon,
but rallied, and talked louder than ever as she ran to
and fro, in great agony of mind. Her husband suffered
less; he was winning at cards, and the expenses
of the party were much lessened as some of
the guests pockets lightened. He even forgot the
absent Macfusses, and wondered that Sara “took on
so.” Supper was announced—the champagne foamed
and sparkled, the corks flew about like hail-stones,
and every body was pleased but poor Mrs. Jones,
who was glad when it ended, and lay down at length
with a terrible <span class='it'>migraine</span>. Then came the nightmare
in the shape of one of her own black cakes thrown at
her head by Mrs. Macfuss—and so ended the party
for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had, however, the consolation of telling her
next door neighbor, who was too sick to accept her
invitation, what an “elegant supper she had, and
how much it had cost her.” She enumerated the
number of empty bottles that <span class='it'>had</span> been full, the loaves
of sugar that were broken up, and the hundreds of
pounds of ice that had been used for freezing, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. The dozens of eggs, the ounces of gelatin!
She had followed Miss Leslie’s receipts, “and,”
added she, taking breath, “you know, Mrs. Hill,
that you <span class='it'>must</span> go to vast expense for that, as she
directs you to take the best of every thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hill did not doubt it, and as she afterward
told her sister, heard an account so minute of the costs
of the entertainment, that she could easily have made
out the bills for the city confectioners and grocers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she did not tell me who were her guests,
Eda; and I really had no opportunity of asking,”
said she, smiling. “Now I might have learned something
more interesting for your benefit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for mine, Fanny,” returned Miss Seymour,
laughing. “Poor Mrs. Jones! she could not tell you
that Mrs. Macfuss did not accept her polite invitation,
and in <span class='it'>her</span> absence, she considered her rooms empty.
Is she not a host within herself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to have seen <span class='it'>her</span> reception of Mrs.
Jones’s envelopes and cards,” exclaimed young Seymour,
rising from the sofa, and seating himself at his
sister’s side. “It is certainly a bore to have such
vulgarians thrust themselves among us. Fancy your
compliance with the request I heard her make <span class='it'>you</span>,
Eda, to ‘Come over and be intimate!’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may look as disdainful as you please, my
exclusive brother,” said Mrs. Hill, laying her white
hand upon his own, “but I prophecy Mrs. Jones’s
rise in the world of fashion as a thing of certain
occurrence, as much as we all now laugh at and
despise her vulgarity and ignorance. She will be as
well considered as you or I, and more, for she has
wealth, and we have only education and high-breeding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell it not in Gath! What, Macfusses and all,
Fanny!” cried her brother. “Impossible! No one is
a prophet in his own country, my dear sister, and thus
I console myself for the shock you have given me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Nous verrons, <a id='nous'></a>ce que nous verrons</span>, Harry,”
said Mrs. Hill, smiling, “but I think I am right.
Human nature is the same all over the world, and I
have learned to study it of late years. Did not Lady
Montague write, that wherever she had gone in her
travels in Europe and the East, she met with ‘men
and women!’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very true, Fanny, but if what you predict comes
to pass, I shall play Timon of Athens, and fly to
Texas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, lame and impotent conclusion!” said Eda,
rising and running her fingers over the harp-strings,
sending a full, clear strain through the apartment.</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“‘If music be the food of love, play on;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Give me excess of it, that surfeiting—’</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I may forget Fanny’s shocking view of fashionable
human nature. She is a perfect old Diogenes, and
deserves no better than a tub! Play, Eda, that ‘music
for a time may change <span class='it'>her</span> nature.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, sing, sister,” said Fanny; “’twill soothe
his troubled spirit sooner. Sing something from Lucia
di Lammermoor, and I will promise not to repeat
my offence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mrs. Hill was right. She did not presume to
deny the title of every one in our own free country
to the equality it claims. She would exclude none
from the advantages of society, let their pedigree be
what it might. She respected honesty, and venerated
truth. She knew that wealth could not confer either,
and was too often acquired in their absence; to her
it covered no faults, mended no reputation, refined
no coarseness of mind, and looking upon it as affording
opportunities of relieving misery, ways of
making others happy, of giving to genius the advantages
of education and learning, it was no wonder
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>
that she sighed, as she witnessed its daily influence on
the minds and hearts of those with whom she mingled.
There was no bitterness in her contemplation of its
consequences, for she was too good and gentle to be
envious, too pious to repine. She had been in the
sunshine of the great world’s favor, and was now
beginning to see its clouds, as her means of affording
mere entertainment to its votaries began to decline.
But, although she felt privations, the want of
comforts to which she had ever been accustomed;
although she felt that wealth can bestow much happiness
on those who know its proper use, she murmured
not, nor thought more of those on whom
fortune was conferring her choicest favors. No
wonder, then, that she could foresee the success of
Mrs. Jones, when with <span class='it'>her</span> accomplishments and
fine, noble mind, the diminution of prosperity brought
her less consideration. The mortification to her
was, not the loss of fortune, but the mistake she
made in fancying that her real worth had been appreciated.
She knew that true hearts could not forsake
her, that true friends could not be changed, and the
rest passed from her mind as a dream that had lasted
too long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Winter approached, and after giving dinners, suppers,
and picknicks innumerable in honor of her
new acquaintance, Mrs. Jones prepared to remove
into her house in town. At the same time Mrs.
Macfuss was ready to do the like, and as mortified as
the former felt at her palpable neglect, it was a comfort
to know that their furniture-wagons went side
by side for six good miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so ended Mrs. Jones’s first year of climbing.
The ladder seemed not so steep, nor the ascent so
difficult; she could look up and smile on those at
the top, while hands were held out to help her as
she mounted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dreamed of Paradise, and began to breathe and
hope. Who would not in her place? She talked
louder than ever, and began to patronize a few, offering
to chaperone very young ladies, or ladies of a
certain age. Her toilette was magnificent, and
began to be elegant. Mrs. Jones had improved decidedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house continued to be thronged with her
usual visiters. Her parlors were a kind of club-room
for young men who staggered about, half-sober,
after having played cards all night, or rested
their weary heads upon the satin pillows of her sofas,
and dozed off the effect of the champagne. Mrs.
Jones declined all further communication with her
former friends, and wrote pompous notes to all who
took any liberty with her name. It was a thing she
could not think of allowing; she had certainly the
right of choosing her associates, and neither herself
nor Mr. Jones could permit any one to question their
conduct in any manner. Indeed, she was often upon
the point of requesting Mr. Jones to impress it upon
the minds of the silly creatures, that she could not
acknowledge the acquaintance of such a promiscuous
set. They had fastened upon her during her residence
at “the Creek,” and she could not shake them
off; she never dreamed of encouraging them, and
had resolved on her return from the North, not to
notice any calls paid her by such an obstinate set.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, indeed!” exclaimed the bosom-friend of
days gone by, upon hearing all this repeated; “she
don’t intend to know us! Perhaps she forgets how
glad she was when aunt invited her and her sister to
a party, and they mortified us so, by coming with
paper crowns on their heads, and little baskets filled
with artificial flowers on their arms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And every one laughed so!” cried another.
“She came to see <span class='it'>me</span> once, with a colored dress on,
trimmed all over with broad white ruffles. Wasn’t
that a costume? I wonder who <span class='it'>she</span> is, to slight us!
She would do better to recollect what she springs
from. Indeed! the time was—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we have not time to repeat the angry sayings
of Mrs. Jones’ friends. Some were told to her, but
she cared not a <span class='it'>sous</span>, since the old set and the new
would never meet to canvass her pedigree or her
paper wreaths of yore. So, bidding a long farewell
to them all, she left for New York, in all the glory of
traveling-dresses, trunks labeled “John Johnson
Jones,” and a white nurse for Master Pushaw.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_1'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>“I dressed myself from top to toe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going out this morning, Sara?” said Mr.
Jones, as he saw an unusual quantity of finery on
the dressing-table, embroidered collars, cuffs, handkerchiefs
and gay ribbons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I have some calls to make—no very important
ones to be sure; I intend dining out to Mrs.
Hill’s place at Summerfield. But as I think it a duty
to assist in putting down the pride of such people, I
wish to go with some eeclaw, and will take Pushaw
with me, to show off his handsome suit. Some of
my friends told me it was folly in me to put myself
to the trouble of calling, but I wish them to see how
mistaken they were, poor things! when they took
upon themselves to treat us with so much indifference
when we were neighbors. The Hills are of no
earthly use, everybody knows that! and I vow and
declare that I saw Mrs. Hill wear that shine silk of
hers two winters ago. I really must ask some of her
acquaintances; it is worth while to ascertain it. I
suppose I must go alone, for I could not ask any one
to be charitable enough to go with me; and after
this, I mean to cut the Seymour and Hill clique most
decidedly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jones took breath, and laughed at her own
wit as though she relished it; and well she might,
for the idea of her being able to “cut people” was a
very funny one to be sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hill is doing a bad business this winter,” said
her husband, buttoning his coat, and straightening
himself before the glass. “He’ll be ‘done up’ at
the end of it, I’ll wager any thing, for he sold his
beautiful horse a short time since, and a man must be
in a poor way to part with such an animal as that is.
Sinclair bought him, and hardly knows how to ride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m sure <span class='it'>I</span> don’t care, for one,” remarked
Mrs. Jones, with great elegance of manner and tone,
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>
as she threw over her shoulders a Brussels cape that
had been sent up by her modiste for her inspection.
“This is splendid, I declare! I’m glad Mrs. Puff
thought of sending this; it is exactly like one Mrs.
Macfuss wore at the Ford’s fine dinner, and so it
must be the fashion. As I was saying, Mr. Jones,
the Hills were rather high with me last summer; I
never could get them to come over and be intimate.
Now there’s Marian Fawney, as sweet a girl as ever
lived, I had only to tell her once, and we’ve been
like sisters ever since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; a little <span class='it'>too</span> intimate for my good,” said Mr.
Jones, as he thought of the constant visits of all Miss
Fawney’s family. “It may all be very fine for you,
Sally, and she may be a very good girl, but I think
she loves rich folks, and no others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, and who don’t?” replied his wife, who
felt herself subject to a similar weakness. “Besides,
Mr. Jones, her acquaintance has been an advantage,
consider that! I have no doubt but that through her
influence we shall have Mrs. Macfuss in our house
before the season is out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D—n Mrs. Macfuss!” exclaimed Mr. Jones, forgetting
Chesterfield in his indignation at the heart-aches
she had given him and his helpmate. “You
expect the Saxons, too, I suppose! For they are as
proud as the others, and as grand in their notions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Saxons dine here on Monday,” said Mrs.
Jones, with a look of triumph. “They called this
week, and I immediately asked them, reserving the
news for one of your cross humors, and you were
just beginning one at the Macfusses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jones “unknit his threatening brow” and
congratulated his wife upon her cleverness. “And
never mind, Sally,” continued he, forgetting to use
the more musical name of Sara, “I’ll pull down
those Macfusses yet, with the fortune I’m making;
for I have sworn to be the wealthiest man in ——,
and I don’t think Macfuss can say as much. I have
the means before me, and if Will can help, ‘there’s
no such word as fail.’ Hurrah, Sally! hurrah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jones was like Richard, “himself again,” and
almost upset the chiffoniere in the middle of the
room. His wife smiled benignantly upon his playfulness,
but thought it time to end his exhilaration
where it began; “for,” said she to herself, “if any
one should hear him!” So she dismissed him by
reminding him of the hour, and Mr. Jones left his
Penates for his sanctuary, the counting-room. In
his mind, if mind it were, there was but one idea,
the one of amassing wealth, and he was as unlike
that being of superiority, man, as the sloth to the bee.
While his limbs moved, while his fingers marked
down the all-important figures, his mind lay dormant,
his soul stagnant; and forgetful of the treasures that
“neither rust nor moth doth consume, where thieves
do not break through nor steal,” he left uneared for
the harvest which we are bound to reap—the harvest
of a good and useful life. Where his treasure was,
there also was his heart; but such things pass away,
and will be like a drop in the ocean; where then
would lie the benefit of all this toil, these struggles
for the vain possessions of a passing world?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Equally heedless of <span class='it'>her</span> real fortune, his wife proceeded
to her duty of <span class='it'>une grande toilette</span>. Calling
her sable handmaid, she gave directions for Master
Pushaw’s outfit, upon this unusual occasion for
display.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dress him in the suit that came from the North,
Cilla,” said she, with an air of Zenobian authority.
“I wish to take him with me. Be prompt, and do
not cross him, for he would cry, and I cannot have
his face swollen. It will disfigure him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were few charms to destroy in Master
Jones’s little dish-face, but his mother descended to
the front parlor with a Gracchi perception of greatness
in embryo, and walked up and down before the
pier-glass until her father’s softened image followed
her. Sundry shrill screams had found their way below,
but as the injuries were entirely confined to
poor Cilla’s face and hands, Mrs. Jones was satisfied.
She surveyed him attentively, and the result was
satisfactory; although Master Pushaw looked very
much as if he were about to mount Miss Foote for a
race, or a circus pony for a ride around the ring.
His clothes were remarkable for their gay color, and
he wore a fools-cap, whose long gold tassel swung
to and fro as his motions grew animated. We have
seen little creatures dressed like, and resembling him—but
they were not children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jones was whirled off in triumph to Mrs.
Hill’s. A pretty cottage, elegantly but simply furnished,
stood unmoved as the splendid equipage
dashed up to the front door. A servant opened it,
at sound of the bell, and answered in plain English
that his mistress was “at home.” Mrs. Jones descended
the steps, and was ushered into the parlor.
Still there was no unusual stir about the place, the
pretty portraits kept in their frames on the wall, and
the flowers remained unwithered at her approach.
Mrs Jones’s astonishment redoubled, and when Mrs.
Hill entered the room, her smiling, blooming countenance
completed the disappointment of her guest.
Nay, her quiet manner, and indifference to the mass
of ribbons, flounces and embroidery that sat before
her, gave Mrs. Jones nervous twitches at the mouth,
and she at length asked for Mrs. Hill’s little boy, certain
of seeing him, as Master Pushaw looked when
he was not “dressed in the suit that came from the
North.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the nurse entered holding by the hand a beautiful
boy, whose smooth, fresh complexion was ornamented
with only the bloom “Nature’s cunning hand
had laid on.” His costume was as unlike a fancy
one as possible, and Mrs. Jones felt the thorn deeper
in her side, as his bright dark eye rested boldly and
scrutinizingly upon his visiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a funny cap!” exclaimed he, as it swung
to and fro when Pushaw turned his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so it is funny, dear!” replied the nurse with
true Irish naiveté.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take the little boy with you, Charley, and get
him a nice biscuit,” said Mrs. Hill, and she felt relieved
as the children left the room. “A glass of
wine will refresh you after the drive, Mrs. Jones,”
continued she, hoping to direct her attention to a different
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>
channel; and pulling the bell, she ordered a
tray of refreshment for her fashionable guest, not
fearing to display the contents of her pantry to such
practiced eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jones swallowed a sponge cake, and washed
it down with a mouthful or two of wine; but it almost
choked her, and she rose to go without having dazzled
Mrs. Hill with an account of her “elegant
dinner-service, and the splendid silver tea-set.” She
remained imperturbable during the enumeration of
the parties Mrs. Jones had attended, and the invitations
she had been forced to decline, so bidding her
hostess good morning, the lady stepped into her carriage
with a feeling of bitter disappointment, “for”
said she, “Mrs. Hill don’t look at all as though her
husband were doing a bad business. Mr. Jones must
be mistaken; no woman on the verge of poverty could
ever look as undisturbed as she did this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No woman like Mrs. Jones <span class='it'>could</span> have been cheerful
under the sad reverses of the young creature whom
she chose to despise. <span class='it'>Her</span> aim was fashion—her
idol wealth. Mrs. Hill cared for neither; she struggled
to preserve in adversity the happiness that had
begun in prosperity. The object of the visit she received
was intelligible to her, and her only emotion
was one of pure amusement as she resumed her quiet
rational pursuits. Mrs. Jones would have disdained
pleasures that occasioned no display. Fanny felt
grateful to the Giver of all good for the resources that
supplied the place of the worldly amusements in which
she could no longer afford to participate; and felt that
however they may gratify for a time, they leave,
from their uselessness, a void in the heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, while she and her husband sat together
in animated, sprightly discourse over some work they
had been reading, four people were assembled around
the centre-table in one of Mrs. Jones’s handsome
parlors. The lady herself, her husband, and Miss
Fawney, with her brother, a little snub-nosed, purple-visaged
fellow, conceited, of course, and fond of
talking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jones held a pencil in her hand. Before her
lay a <span class='it'>portfeuille</span> of unexceptionable shape and hue,
and on a sheet of satin paper she was writing a list
of the guests to be invited to a ball Miss Fawney
thought it advisable for her to give. It was a popularity
party, but as she catered for patronage that
needed notes from the élite, not from the vulgar, it
was a very exclusive affair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every thing shall be perfectly <span class='it'>elegunt</span>, Marian—so
be as select as you please, my love, I fear no
rivalry in business like this; Mrs. Macfuss shall see
herself at home, if she accepts,” said Mrs. Jones,
raising her head proudly, and smiling as she concluded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right, Sara!” said her husband, stroking
his small crop of <a id='whisk'></a>whiskers. “Go the whole hog, and
give us something out of the way.” (Mr. Jones was
forgetting Chesterfield, decidedly, but then he had
not so much need to learn refinement, since his rise
in the world.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do mind him for once, Mrs. Jones, although you
ladies don’t love obedience to the conjugal yoke,”
observed Mr. Fawney, screwing up his face to refrain
from laughing at his own wit. “All the young
men in town are wishing that you would give a party.
They know what they may expect, I can tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do they, indeed?” said the lady, expanding.
“Then lose no time, Marian Fawney, I leave the
invitations to you, for you know none but the first
people here, and we can ask as many as you will
write down. I give you <span class='it'>coorte blonche</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you, dear Mrs. Jones,” cried she, embracing
that lady with great affection, and filled with delight
at the commission given her. “How kind of you to
leave every thing to me! But then you know how
much I feel—” Miss Fawney here wept a little, and
wiping her eyes and snuffling, resumed: “Now we’ll
begin with—the Macfusses, of course—then the
Fentons—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But none of them have called on Sara,” interrupted
Mr. Jones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they will—I know that they intend it. Mrs.
Macfuss told me the other day that Mrs. Jones entered
a room like a Parisian, and that her dress was perfect!”
said Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This appeased Mr. Jones, and so enraptured his
wife, that it was a pity it was not true; but Miss
Fawney told an untruth so gracefully that falsehood
became in her <span class='it'>plus belle que la belle verité</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall Mrs. Hill be invited?” asked she in a tone
that plainly demanded a negative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Might as well,” said Mr. Jones, picking his teeth
with fashionable ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor thing!” sighed Miss Fawney, while her face
lengthened as she assumed a look of compassion,
“does she go out this winter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Jones says her husband does a bad business
this season,” observed Mrs. J. “She can’t get a
ball-dress, what’s the use of tempting her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever principled, my dear Mrs. Jones!” cried
Miss Fawney, much affected a second time, but restraining
her tears. “However, she might borrow
one from her sister,” continued she, feeling that the
more she dwelt upon Mrs. Hill’s reverses, the less
inclined Mrs. Jones was to be polite to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D—n it, let ’em come!” said the master of the
house, conscious of no reason for slighting people
who were never rude. “What’s the difference to
Sally how they dress! She don’t lose by it, does
she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have such a kind heart!” cried Marian,
taking his hand, and gazing upon him with a look of
two-fold approbation; but Mr. Jones turned away,
wondering inwardly “what in heaven’s name the
girl was forever crying about!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Sara, decide! shall the invitation be
written, or not?” said he, somewhat impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” said the lady, positively, for she had just
remembered Mrs. Hill’s indifference to her costly
silk, her new carriage, and Pushaw’s fancy cap.</p>

<hr class='tbk104'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Fanny,” said Miss Seymour, as she stepped from
her carriage one evening at her sister’s door, “come
with me, wont you? I am going to drive on to the
city, having some <span class='it'>emplettes</span> to make, and we can call
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>
on Mrs. Jones as we return. The sound of her
silvery voice will re-animate you this evening, for
you do not look so well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hill was not as cheerful as was her wont, for
her prospects did not brighten, and she had been
sitting on the steps, thinking, until a few tears rolling
over her sweet face, left their glaze, and did not
escape Eda’s eye of affection. Ever willing to oblige,
however, and anxious to resume her usual looks,
before her husband should return to mark and grieve
over her sadness, she assented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must wait awhile, Eda, until I change my
dress; I must put on a more ceremonious costume,
for Mrs. Jones has ceased asking me to ‘come over
and be intimate’ since my fortunes are changing.
This satin de laine would be an insult after the magnificence
with which she assailed me two weeks
ago? Can you give me time to make <span class='it'>une toilette
soignée</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” said Miss Seymour, seating herself
and taking her little nephew on her lap, “although you
require but a slight change in my humble opinion, to
present yourself at Mrs. Jones’s door.” Fanny smiled
and hastened in; but soon returned, looking pretty
enough to make the fine lady jealous, in despite of
her simple attire. She had that real elegance of
manner which Mrs. Jones so much admired in herself,
but could not see in others that failed to prosper
in the world’s estimation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was “at home,” the servant said, and they
were ushered in by an African damsel, in washing
attire. Her clothes were looped about her waist like
a <span class='it'>blanchisseuse</span>, and she displayed a pair of ebony
legs ending with wide, naked feet. Her drapery was
not like her mistress’s company, “select,” but
seemed to hold the accumulated dust and dirt of the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seated in the parlors, the sisters had leisure to
contemplate the contents of the apartment they had
often heard described. Two portraits hung opposite.
One represented Mrs. Jones in ball costume, giving
the finishing touch to her toilette. On her lap was
a very work-box looking casket, out of which she
was taking a string of most unequivocal wax-beads,
supposed to resemble pearls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jones sat bolt upright, with a book in his hand,
looking very learned, and very much puzzled about
some weighty question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what struck them most was, that on the
tables in the corners, stood cake-baskets, covered
with doilies, and candlesticks innumerable were
disposed about the room, with unlit candles, and
curled paper wound around them. Some of the
baskets contained cake that plainly looked, “don’t
touch me yet,” and we forgot to mention a tub of
rather muddy water that stood in the middle of the
folding-doors, on a large oil-cloth, as though the dark
damsel, with the very short garments, had been interrupted
in the act of scouring paint at this untimely
hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Jones has scrubbing done at a strange time,”
said Eda, pointing to the implements before mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, Eda! I’m sure that we have called at a
very wrong hour,” said Fanny, pointing in her turn
to the cake and candles. “Does not that look like a
bidding of guests to the banquet hall?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does, indeed. What have we done, Fanny?
How could we know of such preparations when the
stupid girl said her mistress was at home? The idea
of scouring at such an hour, too! Housekeeping
should be like the mechanism of the clock—we know
that it goes, but do not see the operation. When was
our house ever seen in such a trim by visiters?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In such an <span class='it'>un</span>trim, you mean to say,” said Fanny;
“but pray do not laugh, Eda, it is like hypocrisy to
do so now, that we have given ourselves the trouble
of coming to see Mrs. Jones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are too good, Fanny; but if you keep your
face serious in that absurd way, striving to practice
what you preach, I shall shriek out,” replied her
sister. “Do laugh, if you feel like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Eda, no!” said Fanny, trying to look grave.
“Do not make me act rudely. <span class='it'>We</span> have made the
mistake, for we live in the country and hear none of
these ‘fine ladies’ doings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw! Mrs. Jones cannot give a party without
<span class='it'>my</span> hearing of it; she owes me the invitation, and
you also.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never shall expect one,” said Mrs. Hill, smiling,
and the servant entered to ask “if Miss Seymour
were in the parlor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Seymour and Mrs. Hill,” said Eda, wondering
what was to come next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, marm, Miss Sarly say, (and I told
her it was you and Mrs. Hill, too,) that she’s been
busy all day, and can’t see no company. Here’s a
ticket for you to come to the party. Miss Sarly say
she never had no time to send it out in the country,
but long’s you are here, she told me to fotch it down.
They a’nt none for you marm,” turning to Fanny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This new way of sending invitations was, in reality,
ignorance on the part of poor Mrs. Jones. She had
not yet been out as far as Mr. Seymour’s country-seat,
and thought it an excellent idea to take advantage
of Eda’s presence in the house. The neglect of
Mrs. Hill was intentional, as we have seen, but it was
<span class='it'>now</span> difficult to say which was most uncontrollable,
Eda’s indignation, or her sister’s amusement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a mind to send it back to her,” cried Eda,
in French. “What gross impertinence!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ignorance, sister; she knew no better, and I told
you I expected nothing from Mrs. Jones,” said
Fanny. “Do let us go, dear Eda! I cannot help it
now, I must laugh! Come”—and she led the way
out, observing that she ought to forgive it, as Mrs.
Jones had not yet unlearned her <span class='it'>habitudes de chaumière</span>.
The door stood open, and behind it was Mrs.
Jones, intent upon hearing what comments were
passed by Mrs. Hill, when she found herself “neglected.”
She had the great satisfaction of knowing
that she was seen, for Fanny’s merry eyes rested full
upon her; and she was somewhat disappointed as she
heard the sweet, silver laugh that echoed behind them
as the carriage rolled away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was not pleasant, but Mrs. Jones remembered
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>
that Mrs. Hill saw no one now, “and, of
course, Miss Seymour wont come when her sister is
not invited. I wish I had not kept on this old gown,
since they spied me out; but, lor! it don’t make any
difference. I wonder what they said, too; I couldn’t
tell from here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She asked Cilla; but Cilla replied that “they didn’t
talk Merrican, and how could <span class='it'>she</span> understand? But
I tell you what, Miss Sarly, I didn’t like to invite
one ’thout tother; and I felt very oncomfortable ’bout
it, too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Cilla had the advantage over her mistress in
good feeling at least, but she was told to hold her
tongue and go to her work, and no one was ever the
wiser by it. But as we wish to give only an account
of the rise of Mr. and Mrs. John Johnson Jones, we
must pay less attention to the little incidents of every-day
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To have slighted Mrs. Hill, “whose husband did
a bad business,” was one triumph—to have secured
Eda’s non-attendance, another. But to receive Mrs.
Macfuss’s acceptance, was one worthy of the gods!
This joyful blow was too much for Mrs. Jones’s
nervous system! She had the paint rescoured, and
Cilla, much discomforted, observed (out of her lady’s
hearing, of course,) “that if cos Mrs. Makefuss is a
comin’ I has to do all my work over, I wish, (oh, my
sakes! if Miss Sarly could hear me!) she’d a kept
her ’ceptance to herself. Here’s Miss Sarly almost
out her head, and when the ’oman <span class='it'>do</span> come, she’ll
be crazy as a coot—and coots is bad off for sense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cilla was not far wrong. When Miss Fawney
communicated the intelligence that an acceptance
was to be sent on the morrow, Mrs. Jones ran about
in playful bewilderment and relieved herself a little
by adding some extra-artificials to her dress. She
borrowed more candlesticks and lamps, and had some
idea of illuminating the house from attic to cellar,
ordering lanterns to be hung at the gate, that Mrs.
Macfuss might not mistake. “And now, Marian,
my dear child,” continued she, turning to her convenient
friend, “do tell me what Mr. and Mrs.
Macfuss like best to eat. What more <span class='it'>can</span> I have on
my table that they would relish? I know they always
have the finest of every thing—think well now, and
let me know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Fawney was a little puzzled at first, but
suddenly recollected what she liked most herself, so
informed Mrs. Jones that Mr. Macfuss was very fond
of <span class='it'>pâté de foie gras</span>, and also of oyster gumbo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The gumbo I have prepared, my love, of course;
but the potty dee foy graws I had almost forgotten.
Gourmand has quantities of potties, as he is a Frenchman,
and imports those articles from Paris direct.
I think you said Mrs. Macfuss liked sherbet and
lemon ice cream?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No; Miss Fawney liked vanilla best, and affirmed
that Mrs. Macfuss was very partial to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she, indeed! Oh, Marian, I had ordered
lemon!” cried Mrs. Jones, in dismay. “Come,
we’ll go to Praline’s this instant and reverse it. And
those pine apples. They must be rich. Smith! have
the carriage round immediately; I’ll go up and put
on my bonnet, Marian;” and when Mrs. Jones
arrived at Praline’s her heart dilated as she saw in
how much consideration she was held by her confectioner
and his wife. They were all smirks and
smiles, particularly as she constantly repeated “you
know now, Mrs. Praline, that I mind no expense
whatever.” And Miss Fawney called her an extravagant
creature! “But I knew, Mrs. Jones, that
when you did give a party, it would be a magnificent
affair!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, indeed, it proved. The weather was fine
and everybody came. Mrs. Macfuss meeting her
own set, and seeing so much display, was reconciled
to her new acquaintance. Mr. Macfuss, seeing a
magnificent supper and drinking the finest of wines,
shook hands with his host, and asked him to come
and see him sociably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pleasant combination of things. The
host and hostess said they never would regret the
ball, and Miss Fawney was profuse in her congratulations.
At length they had reached the goal, and
began to feel with Mr. and Mrs. Vincent Crummles,
the sweets of popularity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jones who heard soon after to say that she
had scarcely time to take her meals, people so
thronged the house; and before she was quite aware
of it, she had asked Mrs. Macfuss to come over and
be intimate!</p>

<hr class='tbk105'/>

<p class='pindent'>One evening, as Mrs. Hill and her brother stood
together at the gate of her pretty cottage, a handsome
equipage dashed by, filling with dust the mouths
of the plebeian pedestrians on either side of the
smooth road through Summerfield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two ladies were on the back seat, while in front
sat two little boys, looking very gravely at one
another. The driver had on a coat filled with brass
buttons—and this was called a livery; so the whole
effect was very grand and imposing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was that, Fanny?” said young Seymour;
“whose carriage is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The carriage belongs to Mrs. John Johnson Jones,
brother. Did you not see her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not recognize her—she bowed, did she not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not she, my good sir; she never bends so low.
Could you not see how stiff the lady was?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then who did bow to you just now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Macfuss,” said Fanny, smiling archly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew! Whose little innocents were those in
front?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Master Pushaw Jones and Master Johnny Macfuss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Seymour paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fanny,” said he at length, “I’ll go to Texas.
I see that Mrs. Macfuss has been over, and is
intimate!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_3'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was the morning of the fifth day after the escape
of Talbot and his companion. The land breeze, like
the breath of expiring humanity, had become more
and yet more faint, until it ceased entirely, and the
flag that was wont to wave over the ramparts of the
Moro Castle hung listless beside the staff which supported
it. Into the cavernous recesses worn by the
friction of the water, in the foundations of the massive
structure, the sluggish waves tumbled with a
dull and deafening sound. In the near offing lay the
frigate, rolling slowly on the unbroken surface of a
light ground swell, while the sails flapped against the
masts, as if impatient for the breeze. In various directions,
a number of vessels, differing in size and
appearance, like the frigate awaited a wind to waft
them to their various destinations. Beyond them,
and until it blended with the distant horizon, save
here and there a sea-gull noiselessly skimming its
surface, there was nothing visible on the far-stretching
and pellucid sea. Like a slumbering giant, the
very heavings of that sea told of the latent power
that dwelt within it, and conveyed a forcible idea of
the might and majesty of the Great Being that
made it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the after part of the deck of the frigate, screened
from the sun by an awning overhead, sat Miss Gillespie
and her brother. She, with an air of unmitigated
sadness; he, chafing at a captivity which he
deemed illegal, and impatient to reach the shore and
obtain his freedom. He had never understood for
what purpose the soporific incense had been burned,
or, boy as he was, he would have attempted the life
of their insidious foe. He had imagined that it was
an attempt on their lives, (for the disaster of the count
had been carefully concealed from them,) and his
sister had shrunk from undeceiving him. Her pure
nature could itself with difficulty comprehend such
baseness, but was absolutely incapable of conveying
an idea of it to another, particularly one whose disposition
was naturally as unsuspecting as her own.
She therefore determined to avoid exciting his suspicions,
and even forbore to interfere further than by
advice, when the steward, at the instance of his
master, now able to sit up, represented that so far
from designing injury, the object was to soothe their
nerves, those of the lady in especial, after the
anxiety and alarm of the evening previous. He also
persuaded Frank that the count would exert himself
to obtain their speedy liberation when they reached
the port; and, that having found them on board of a
privateer of the enemy, a class of vessels not in the
habit of conveying passengers, he was, by the strict
tenor of his orders, bound, although most reluctantly,
to detain them. These representations so far operated
upon the youth, that he was several times prevailed
upon to visit the designing count. But his
sister pertinaciously refused to see, or receive any
message from her persecutor, and might have departed
from her resolution and told Frank sufficient
to prevent him from leaving her alone, but that in her
fears for Talbot she had forgotten every thing else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although a prisoner, confined apart and denied all
intercourse, the mere presence of her lover in the
same vessel gave her a sense of security. But now
he was gone, whither and wherefore she could not
tell, and she felt as if she were abandoned to the
dreadful fate which so long had threatened her. To
do her justice, too, her bitterest source of grief was
in anxiety for the safety of Talbot. Had she heard
nothing of him, she would have concluded that he
was still among the prisoners, and by the strict vigilance
of his guards denied the opportunity of communicating
with her. But her persecutor was too
malignant, was also too shrewd not to know that if
he could persuade her of her lover’s desertion, he
might more reasonably hope for success. She was
therefore but too soon informed of the escape, of
which the missing boat was sufficient proof; and
through others every representation was made, calculated
to impair her confidence and weaken her
attachment. But, like a mail of proof, her own integrity
protected her, and the malicious shafts fell
harmless, creating no pain, and scarce attracting
notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although young and inexperienced, scarce more
than a nestling that had for the first time fledged its
wing, this girl possessed the noblest attributes of her
sex, and hers was more than the ordinary love of
woman. True, deep, fervent love, such as that sex
alone can feel, cannot harbor a doubt. Undying and
unchangeable in itself, it cannot comprehend that, of
the existence of which it is unconscious. Often
placed unhappily, often denied the communion for
which it yearns, it looks beyond the grave for the
fruition of its hopes.</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“They sin who tell us love can die.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>She had listened to the soft and hesitating whisper
of proffered love, and her gushing eye and mantling
cheek and throbbing breath had confessed that love
to be requited. Her soul had mingled with another’s
in the dearest and the noblest union which adorns
and irradiates existence—the union of manly strength
with shrinking beauty; of the clear eye to look upon,
and the bold heart to encounter peril, with the step
hesitating and timid as a fawn! of skill to do and
will to dare, with affection to sustain and fortitude to
endure; of man, fashioned in comeliness and radiant
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>
with virtue, with woman, the celestial link that binds
him to a purer state! With a pledge as dear as it
was enduring, they had sworn to preserve that union
until it should be merged into that most glorious,
holiest and most beautiful of all, which is effected in
death—when their souls, stripped of the mortal coils
which encumbered them, and wafted on the wings
of love, should soar upward and onward, until side
by side, inseparable as in life, and inseparable forever,
they intoned their hymns of praise with the
choir which surrounds the Eternal!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could a woman capable of conceiving such a
pledge ever falter, much less prove unfaithful?
Never. And Miss Gillespie was as unmoved by the
insinuations of those around her, as is the calm and
placid moon by the howlings of a hungry wolf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the two orphans sat apart, occasionally exchanging
a few words, and then relapsing into
silence, the first lieutenant, an old and worthy officer,
who, from the want of family influence, had long
been denied promotion, touched by the sadness of the
fair captive, approached and respectfully accosted
them. He first confined himself to inquiries respecting
their health and comfort, and made some cheering
observations on their prospects of liberation.
He then, after musing a few moments, left them
and whispered a few words to the officer of the deck.
The latter nodded intelligence, and immediately gave
an order which required those of the crew hovering
about to go forward to aid in its execution. The
lieutenant then returning said, “Young lady, may I
speak a few words with you?” and leading her a
few steps from where her brother sat, continued, “I
have two daughters at home, one of them about your
age, and when I think how I should feel if either of
them were in your almost unprotected situation, I
sympathize deeply with you. Indeed I am not the
only one. There is a general feeling among the officers
to protect you if need be. You may rely upon
our disposition to serve you—and now answer me
frankly—Does your extreme sadness proceed solely
from your detention here, and the escape and apparent
desertion of your friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no, sir!” cried she, immeasurably relieved
by his words, “whatever may have induced Mr.
Talbot to leave us, I am sure that he has acted for
the best. You judge rightly,” she added, “in supposing
that I have other cause of anxiety than what
proceeds from our detention, which, if we be not
most unjustly dealt by, must terminate so soon. I
have not dared to tell my brother what horrid fears
distract me, for I know he would attempt something
violent, that would most probably separate us, and I
love my only protector.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our fears then are not unfounded, and the mystery
of that night is partly solved,” said the lieutenant,
in a soliloquizing tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What night? Of what mystery do you speak?”
exclaimed the lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of the night you came on board. But is it possible
you are ignorant of what I allude to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not the most remote idea; Frank and I
slept soundly the whole night, and did not awake
until late the next morning. I remember that at first
we thought that an attempt was being made to stupefy
or smother us with something that was burned,
but, as we were not molested, we concluded that we
had been mistaken. For God’s sake, tell me what
happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young lady,” he answered, “I have ever since
sought an opportunity to speak to you; why is it
that you have confined yourself below?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We often wished to come up,” she replied, “but
were told that the count was too ill to be consulted,
and that without his permission we could not leave
the cabin. But do tell me all about that night, I implore
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lieutenant then informed her of the condition
in which the count was found the next morning, and
the general belief of the officers that his villainous
design had been frustrated by Talbot or Gonzalez,
who must have been concealed in the cabin. They
conversed for some time, and before leaving her, he
advised her, as the count was nearly well, to keep
always near her brother, and to write a note to the
American Consul in Havana, claiming his protection,
promising that if she would send her note to him he
would forward it at once to its destination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With diminished fear, and in a comparatively
cheerful mood, Miss Gillespie returned to the cabin,
and repeated to her brother such parts of her conversation
with the lieutenant as she thought she could
safely confide to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About the usual hour the breeze set in, and sailing
“majestically slow,” by the towering fortress on the
one hand, and the gay and beautiful structures of the
town, with its crowded wharves and numerous shipping
on the other, the frigate, early in the afternoon,
had anchored in the upper harbor of Havana.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frank Gillespie, who was no longer restricted to
the cabin, watched his opportunity and slipped into
the old lieutenant’s hand the note with which his
sister had entrusted him. Soon after the ship had
cast her anchor, the Captain of the Port came on
board to pay his official visit. The lieutenant, who
was on intimate terms with him, invited him down
to his state-room, and there giving him the note, with
the assurance that it was of very great importance,
exacted a promise that he would transmit it without
delay to the American Consul. The officer promised
to attend punctually to the commission, and the kind-hearted
lieutenant with great satisfaction saw him, a
short time afterward, take his departure for the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quite late in the afternoon, when the ship was
moored, the count, unable to go himself, sent the
first lieutenant to wait upon the admiral and report
the ship. About dusk, and before he returned, a boat
came alongside for Miss Gillespie and her brother.
The person who came in charge stated that the American
Consul was absent and would not return for a
day or two, but that his wife had prepared a room
for, and would gladly welcome them. The message
ended with an entreaty that they would come at
once. They needed no persuasion, and with alacrity
making their brief preparation, and without meeting
obstructions, which to the last they feared, with indescribable
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span>
joy they took their seats in the boat and
bade adieu to their late floating prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Talbot and Gonzalez, representing themselves as
having escaped from a wreck, were kindly received
at the little settlement where they landed, but instead
of accepting the hospitalities which were freely tendered,
they merely asked for a guide to conduct them
into the interior, so fearful were they of being pursued.
With much toil and privation, and at one time
exposed to imminent peril, they reached the Reglos,
a settlement opposite to the city of Havana, the very
day on which the frigate arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afraid to venture out before night-fall, one of them
feigned to be sick, and the other remained as if to
keep him company, in the small room of an obscure
fonda, which they occupied. They had remained
for a very long time without seeing or hearing any
one, when, about an hour after the ship had anchored,
they heard footsteps on the creaking staircase, and
one called out, “Is there any one above, Marguerita?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There were two sailor-looking men there this
morning,” replied a female voice, “but they must
have gone out, for I have heard nothing of them since
dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will see,” said the first voice. But Gonzalez
was too quick for him. He had started at the
first word, and rising from the bed, which was at the
side of the room, placed himself by the door, and
quietly turning the bolt of the lock, withdrew the
key. He then bent his head and listened attentively,
taking care not to place it in a line with the key-hole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The party, consisting of three, came up in the
meantime, and two of them proceeded to an adjoining
room, while one stopped and tried the door. In
a few moments he rejoined his companions, saying,
“All safe, they are out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Gonzalez started up and hurried to the door,
Talbot was struck as much by the expression of his
countenance as by the movement itself, and he had
continued to watch him in silent amazement. But he
was soon convinced that his friend was not insane.
When the person who tried the door had retired,
Gonzalez, stepping lightly to the bed, whispered,
“Don’t speak or make the slightest noise, it is the
rascally steward, with some of the cut-throats who
resort to this side of the harbor. The count has some
design afoot, and Providence has sent us just in time
to save that unfortunate young lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Talbot needed no more, and with their faculties on
the full stretch, they listened intently, and gathered
almost every word of the conversation in the next room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a festival day in Havana. The clang of
the bells had been incessant since noon, and the air
reverberated with the almost uninterrupted discharge
of artillery from the forts and men-of-war. There
was no diminution of light with the setting of the
sun, for the clouds which slowly floated along the sky,
threw back the blaze of the illuminated city, while,
like an undulating mirror, the harbor reflected the
myriads of lights interspersed among the spars and
rigging of the men-of-war. Along the shore, in each
direction, bonfires were blazing, and from every point
as well of the waters as the land, was heard the
whizzing sound of the sinuous and beautiful rocket,
which, exploding above and around with an unceasing
feu de joie, filled the air with its fiery flakes. The
sound of music and the shouts of merriment commingled,
and wafted by the breeze, fell gratefully
upon the ear of the boatmen reclining upon their
oars, and the distant sentinels making their solitary
rounds on the ramparts of the castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the boat with Frank and his sister pushed off
from the frigate, another, and much smaller one, that
had hovered within the shadow of the ship, noiselessly
pursued the same direction. The first pulled
for some distance up the river, until it had passed
the city, and then stopped at one of the neat villas
that lined its banks. The smaller boat, which, as the
reader must have surmised, contained Talbot and
Gonzalez, had been obliged to keep close within the
other shore, to avoid observation. When the larger
boat was turned toward the shore, the two friends,
unseen themselves, distinctly saw all that passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not understand this movement,” said Gonzalez.
“They have stopped at a Posada, to which
the citizens, in their evening rides, usually resort for
refreshment. There must be some change in their
plans since we heard them discuss it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, the party, (with the exception of
one who remained by the boat,) had landed, and
ascending the bank, opened the little wicker-gate and
proceeded through the garden toward the house.
Talbot and Gonzalez were about to pull across, and
had nearly reached the line of light when the latter
cried, “Hush! back, back your oars quickly, they
are returning!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They again retreated within the shadows of the
opposite bank, and saw two men, followed by a third,
hurrying the lady rapidly toward the boat, into which
they forced her, for it was evident that she was struggling.
The moment she was placed in the boat, they
again shoved off from the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I now understand it all,” whispered Gonzalez to
his companion. “They have decoyed the brother
into the house, and run off and left him. I am sure,
too, that the lady is gagged, for she does not cry out,
although she yet struggles desperately. Stop, stop!
What are you about?” he cried, as he saw Talbot
begin to ply his oars with all his might.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you ask me, with such a sight before us,”
replied the latter, indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, lay on your oars, I beg, I entreat you.
Your precipitation will ruin all. They are four, and
well armed—we are defenceless. They would slay
us before we could cope with them, and then farewell
to all hopes of the lady’s rescue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall we do, then?” said Talbot, as he despairingly
rested his oar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Follow them, as we at first proposed, and concert
our plan after we have seen the place in which
they mean to place her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gonzalez,” said Talbot, “you have not so much
at stake as I in this matter, and you are therefore
less agitated and better qualified to adopt the course
we should pursue. I will not be rash if I can help
<span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span>
it; but, come what may, I will not again lose sight of
Mary. She has no father; her brother is torn from
her. I am her sole protector. I will die before I
desert her for an instant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have told you of my sister, Talbot,” said Gonzalez,
“and you must know I have a motive that
impels me, which is as powerful as your own.
Love is your incentive, and revenge is mine.
Yours is the most impetuous, but mine, as the more
cautious, is more certain to effect its object. I pray
you be moderate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, Gonzalez, with the condition I have
named.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While they were speaking, they had not ceased to
watch the movements of the larger boat, which
pulled about half a mile farther up, and landed on the
same side. The smaller boat following their motions
with the utmost caution, was run ashore a short
distance below, and the two friends crept along under
cover of the thick brush that lined the bank, to within
a few paces of the ruffians. A carriage was in
waiting, the driver standing beside it. As soon as
the latter saw them, he opened the door, let down
the steps, and then ascended his box. Two of the
gang forced the lady into the carriage, and followed
after; the third closed the door and mounted beside
the driver. While this was taking place, Talbot was
endeavoring to free himself from the grasp of Gonzalez,
who tried to detain him. With a violent
effort he succeeded, and springing forward, leaped
upon the foot-board of the carriage just as the driver
had applied the lash, and the horses started off at half
speed. The remaining ruffian, seeing Talbot rush
by, turned to pursue him and give the alarm, when
Gonzalez sprung upon him, and violently struggling,
they fell to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The patriot, on the eve of a battle which is to decide
the fate of his country; the secreted lover, impatient
for the footfall of the mistress of his affections;
the young mother, beside the sick couch of an only
child, are all less vigilant in their watchfulness, than
the specious villain who seeks to hold a fair character
with the world, while he covertly gives full indulgence
to his depraved and licentious appetites.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The count had every reason to believe his plot
well matured, and in a fair train for execution, and
yet he felt restless and uneasy. The critical period
between the conception and consummation of any
conspiracy, even when the judgment sanctions and
the true heart approves it, is the most trying of all the
situations in which human nature can be placed; but
when the object is detestable, the means base and
treacherous, and the agents employed unprincipled,
then, the suspense is torturing—for the slightest accident,
the most trivial carelessness may frustrate, and
the faithlessness of the least trusted agents betray the
best concerted plot that was ever laid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some days the count had feigned to be weaker
than he really was, and no sooner had Frank and his
sister left than he jumped up and leaned out of one
of the ports to see them embark, and to satisfy himself
that no one from the ship accompanied them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is said that the Evil One favors his own, and in
this instance the adage was verified. No one had
yet descended the side, and as the count cast his
scrutinizing glance in every direction, his quick ear
detected the light splash of an oar. Withdrawing
instantly, he extinguished the lamp and excluded
as well as he could, the light of the illumination
which streamed through the opposite ports. Returning
then to his first position, in a few moments,
as his eye became accustomed to the obscurity, he
saw indistinctly the small boat which contained
Talbot and Gonzalez. The outlines of the boat were
alone visible, and he could not make out how many
persons it contained. It was, he thought, most probably,
the boat of some poor fisherman, compelled to
forego present enjoyment in order to procure tomorrow’s
subsistence for himself and family. Guilt,
however, is always suspicious, and without being
able to assign to himself a reason for his misgivings,
he summoned his steward and gave him a few hurried
instructions. The latter, immediately leaving
the apartment, slipped through one of the gun-deck
ports as Talbot and Gonzalez had done before him,
and, unseen from the upper-deck, descended into the
boat just before it shoved off. The fears awakened
(wherefore he could not tell) by the sight of the tiny
boat, had induced the count to change his entire plan.
It was therefore that Talbot, when he found that the
preconcerted plot they had heard discussed was not
adhered to, determined not to lose sight of his mistress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the large boat stopped at the posada, the
orphans were conducted to a private room, the
steward and two of the gang remaining without, soon
after a servant-maid entered, and said that the consul’s
lady was indisposed, and had sent her to beg
that Miss Gillespie would come to her chamber.
With unsuspecting alacrity the poor girl rose up and
followed the maid. At a turn in the passage, she
was seized, a gag instantly applied to her mouth, and
then hurried to the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frank, who, unsuspecting as his sister, sat in
patient expectation, started up as he heard a stifled
scream. At the same moment he was felled to the
floor by a blow of the ruffian, who, with a heavy
cudgel, had crept behind him. The miscreant then
dragging the body into a closet opening from the
room, hastened after his companions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The steward, as soon as the party landed at the
posada, had dispatched a sure messenger to direct
the carriage to proceed from the place where he
knew it was in waiting, to the spot designated by
the count in his last instructions. It was not distant,
and, as we have seen, was at the appointed place before
the boat arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The steward and his party, warned by the count,
had kept a vigilant look out, to ascertain if they were
followed by another boat; but, themselves in the
broad glare of light, they could not catch the slightest
glimpse of the one, which, much smaller and screened
by the obscurity, hovered sufficiently near to observe
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The carriage, with the ruffians, the victim of their
toils, and that victim’s determined champion, was
driven at a rapid rate along the road which ran
<span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span>
parallel with the stream for a mile or more, when it
turned into one of the bye-roads on the right, which,
as it was less frequented, they pursued at increased
speed for nearly two hours. Overcome by terror
and exhaustion, Miss G. had swooned away some
time, and lay unnoticed on the back seat of the carriage.
At length they stopped at a gate on the left,
and the driver’s companion got down to open it.
Heretofore Talbot had remained at little risk, for the
carriage was closed behind, but, as the man who dismounted
would certainly wait until the carriage had
passed through, in order to close the gate, he was
exposed to certain peril of detection if he remained.
The road was clear where it passed, and there was a
slight ascent from it on the left, at the summit of
which stood the gate. There was no bush or cover
to conceal him, and to descend was out of the question.
Beside the gate, on the right, was a large tree,
that stood just within the inclosure. While Talbot
hesitated what to do, the carriage ascended the slope,
and as it passed through the gateway, one of the
branches of the tree swept its roof. On the instant,
quick as thought, Talbot caught hold of the limb, and
swung himself into the tree. The rustling noise he
made startled the man who stood beside the gate,
and who had certainly been drinking freely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo! what’s that?” he cried, and springing up
to the box, called out, “Drive on! drive on! It’s a
wild beast! But I’ll have a shot at it,” he added, as
the carriage rolled on, and turning partly round, he
discharged his pistol into the tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The driver, with an imprecation, had called out to
his companion not to fire; but he was too late, and
at the report the horses affrighted, ran off at full speed.
The ruffians within the carriage, as well as the one
without, were instantly awakened to a full sense of
their danger. They were all acquainted with the
place, and knew that a short distance ahead, certainly
not more than a third of a mile, the road inclined
short to the left, to avoid an old quarry, which had a
precipitous fall of 15 or 16 feet. As cowardly as
base, each one thought only of his own safety. The
ruffian in front clambered over the roof and leaped
off from behind; the others forced open a door and
precipitated themselves, one after the other, and all
fell with violence and more or less injured to the
ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beside Miss Gillespie within the carriage, the
driver alone remained, and he, with his feet pressed
hard upon the foot-board, and with his body bent
forward, bore his whole weight upon the reins.
Although they passed with breathless velocity, he
accurately noted every object along the road, and
was prepared, at the critical moment, to turn the
horses from the direction of the perilous chasm.
With a quick eye and ready hand the instant that he
saw the turn, with all his might he pulled upon the
left hand rein. This over exertion ensured defeat,
the rein snapped asunder with the strain, and the
horses rushing headlong, were with the carriage precipitated
over the bank. The driver fell upon some
fragments of rock, and laid senseless and immoveable.
The horses, by their moans, and the faint
efforts they made to extricate themselves, showed
that they were severely bruised. Miss Gillespie laid
on the battered side of the carriage, partially revived
from her swoon by the shock she had sustained and
the excruciating pain she felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Talbot, unharmed by the discharge of the pistol,
sprung to the ground, and hurried at his utmost
speed after the carriage, as soon as he saw that the
horses had run away. He passed the bodies of the
ruffians on the road without heeding them, although
one, rising up, called out and limped after him, and
reached the spot a few minutes after the accident
occurred. In his excited state, it was but the work
of a moment to extricate his mistress, to press her
to his bosom, to examine her hurts, and to hurry
with her yet scarce animate body into the neighboring
wood. His first anxiety was for water, and pursuing
the declivity of the ground in a direction leading
from the road, he soon heard the trickling of a
rivulet. He laid his load gently beside it, and on
examination discovered that Mary had received a
severe cut in her head, which bled profusely, and
that her left arm was broken. The loss of blood, the
cooling effects of the water, which he freely applied,
and the pain she endured, all accelerated her return
to consciousness, and in a little while, was enabled
to thank her lover in expressions, brief, indeed, but
touching, and which, like the stamp of the mint on
standard coin, are treasured by the heart that receives
them in imperishable remembrance. They had no
time, however, for interchange of feeling. They
were strangers, and upon the grounds of a powerful
and persevering enemy. It was necessary, therefore,
that they should leave the place as soon as possible,
in order that if overtaken, it might be on land
not peopled with the myrmidons or subject to the jurisdiction
of the count. With the simple means at his
disposal, the water which babbled at their feet, a few
splints, made of the twigs which grew around them,
and the bandages torn from his own garments, Talbot
soon dressed the wounds, and temporarily assuaged
the anguish which his mistress endured. She laid
for some time without a movement or a murmur.
The heavy air was laden with fragrance, and now
and then the pattering on a leaf would tell how abundantly
the dew had fallen. He watched her closely,
in the hope that she was in a slumber, but he soon
perceived that her features were occasionally flushed
by intensity of pain. In truth, her arm had now
begun to swell, and was exceedingly stiff and sore.
He saw that it was necessary to procure shelter and
medical attendance without delay. But whither
should he proceed? The night was now far advanced.
The pall of darkness was just lifting in the east;
faint, tremulous lines of light began to stream along
the sky, revealing a succession of ridges of vapor,
through which, with lessening ray, the morning star
occasionally glimmered. The laborers would soon
be abroad, and it was indispensably necessary to proceed.
Prevailing upon Mary to make an effort, he
was with the greatest difficulty enabled to support
her, while they slowly threaded their way through
the thick undergrowth of the woodland. After wandering
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span>
a short time, they came to a hedge of cactus,
some of the plants in full bloom, the brilliant tints of
their gorgeous flowers heightened and suffused by the
golden rays of the now rising sun. They turned into
a path which led along the hedge toward the high-road.
On their right, towering above the tangled brushwood,
were many trees, mostly large, and some of them
magnificent. The most conspicuous were the assumah,
the ya yati, and the robla,<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> but the grandest and most
beautiful <a id='ofall'></a>of all, the lordly frangipan, with its deep-green
leaves and thickly studded scarlet blossoms. On the
other side of the hedge was an extensive field of sugar-cane,
in all the rich luxuriance of a matured and
abundant crop. An immense mass of foliage, of the
liveliest green, thick and impenetrable in its growth,
its tops waved gracefully in the wind with a rustling
sound that was borne onward until it died away in
the distance. On the opposite side, visible through
the hedge, the field was skirted by a forest, which,
ascending a slope behind it, and becoming thinner as
it ascended, left only a few trees scattered here and
there along the ridge which bounded the western
horizon. But Mary, striving to conceal her weakness
and suppress the moans that were every instant
rising to her lips, and Talbot, who was wholly engrossed
by anxiety for her, could neither of them
enjoy the natural beauties of the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they had proceeded a few hundred yards,
they came to a small gate set in an opening in the
hedge. Talbot soon forced it open, and they emerged
upon a wagon-road which ran between the hedge and
the cane. But Mary could proceed no farther, and
seating her on the road-side, Talbot, himself in a
state of indescribable anxiety, endeavored to cheer
her with hopes of speedy relief.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_4'>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The first lieutenant returned to the frigate about
half an hour after Frank and his sister had left, and
was delighted to hear that the American consul had
sent for them. Soon after he had made his report,
the count ordered his boat, and left the ship. Supposing
that he was summoned ashore by some of the
letters he had received, the old lieutenant little
dreamed that the departure of his commander, in any
manner, had reference to the orphans. He believed
them safe, and with many <a id='claims'></a>claims upon his attention,
dismissed them readily from his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The count steered his boat to the usual landing-place,
and hiring a caleche, proceeded directly to the
western gate. Here he was detained but a moment,
for the officer immediately coming out, recognized
his rank, and he was allowed to pass. Impatient of
delay he took the reins himself, and drove with a
speed proportioned to the ardor of his licentious
passion, and his vindictive yearning, by its gratification,
to wreak vengeance upon her lover—whose
hand he felt sure had before frustrated him. There
was a near cut through a neighboring plantation,
which struck a road leading to the rear of his hacienda,
and saved upward of two miles in distance. As he
was well acquainted with the owner of the plantation,
without hesitation he took the road through it.
Once or twice he thought that he heard the sound of
horses’ hoofs at a rapid pace ahead of him, but the
rattling of the vehicle he was in rendered the sound
uncertain, and he took it for granted that he was
mistaken. When he reached the rear of the building
he alighted, and liberally recompensing the driver,
opened the postern gate with a key he carried, and
proceeded directly to the house. To the attendant
who obeyed his summons, he said impatiently,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The young lady, where is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In her chamber,” was the reply, and in obedience
to a gesture of the count, the servant proceeded
along the corridor and approached an apartment
at its extremity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fools! Why have they put her there?” muttered
the count.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Señor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand aside, sir!” and pushing by, he threw
open the door and entered the apartment. As he did
so, he started back appalled and terrified. Propped
on a bed, catching her breath with difficulty, was a
dying woman. The blood was streaming from her
mouth, and at each respiration gurgled in her throat.
It was the young, the once pure and lovely Esperanza,
the sister of Gonzalez. By the bedside stood
the brother, regarding him with a look of fixed and
deadly hatred. But he moved not his arm from the
sinking form it supported. The unhappy girl with
staring eyes and outstretched hands, uttering inarticulate
and guttural sounds, strove in vain to speak
to them. In the effort the attenuated chords of life
were snapped asunder, and she fell back a corpse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Conde de Ureña,” said Gonzalez, “behold your
work! I came here to protect the victim of your
present plot—little dreaming of the sight that awaited
me. That poor girl must be avenged! You or I,
one or both, must bear Esperanza company.” As he
looked toward the bed his voice softened with emotion,
but recovering himself instantly, he advanced
to the door and bolted it; then drawing a pair of pistols
from his bosom, he sternly added as he presented
them, “take your choice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now! not here! to-morrow! any time! any
where else!” said the count, his cheek blanched and
his brow beaded with perspiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here! Upon this spot! This very instant!”
shouted Gonzalez. “Vile seducer and murderer,”
he added, “you have killed your man! Where is
your vaunted courage? Will that arouse you?”
and he struck him a fierce blow. The count’s face
flushed, he clutched the weapon, and turning to Gonzalez
with a look as vindictive as his own, sternly
motioned him to take his position. How corroding
is the effect of vice! Time was when the unhappy
nobleman would have shrunk in horror from the
contaminating touch of one guilty of a crime, the
dreadful consequences of which, in all the appalling
majesty of death, were then before him. And yet,
more fiend-like than such a wretch, he stood in all
the concentrated hatred of a duelist, prepared to take
the life of the brother of his victim. By a career of
<span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span>
vice, the once honorable man had been converted
into a demon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The combatants confronted each other, leveled
their weapons, and fired so simultaneously that the
reports sounded as one. The pistol of Gonzalez was
struck from his hand and one of his fingers shattered.
Heedless of the pain, as the reverberation ceased, he
bent forward to see if his adversary were unhurt.
Partially concealed by a spiral wreath of smoke, the
count stood seemingly unscathed before him. But
the moment after his weapon dropped, he pressed his
hand to his side, and casting a look of anguish and
despair upon the corpse of the woman he had ruined,
tottered, reeled, and fell heavily upon the floor!
The threat of Gonzales was verified. Almost instantaneously,
two souls were summoned to their dread
account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Gonzalez sprung upon the boatman from
behind, he took him so much by surprise that he had
hurled him over and pointed a dagger to his throat
before he could muster presence of mind enough to
defend himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Villain,” said Gonzalez, “lie still, and answer
me truly, or I pin you to the earth. I already know
enough to tell if you deceive me. As you value
your life, say where has that carriage gone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A la hacienda Frangipina, señor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why doesn’t it go to Mariel, as first intended?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yo no say, señor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you swear that what you tell me is true?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si, señor, por mi alma.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw! Your soul is forfeit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Por la Señora Nuestra.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll believe you, for my countrymen never
deceive when they swear ‘by our Lady.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then permitted him to rise, and proceeded to
question him further. He soon found that the ruffian
could be as readily employed to defeat as to forward
a nefarious plot. Gonzalez knew the hacienda well,
and with the aid of the boatman procured a horse and
was enabled to reach it some ten minutes before the
count. Like the latter, he too had asked for la señorita,
(the young lady,) and by a similar mistake of the
servant, who knew nothing of the plot, he was shown
to his sister’s chamber. He had heard of her ruin,
but knew not that she had been decoyed from their
father’s roof. He found her very ill, and her agitation
at seeing him brought on a profuse and fatal
hemorrhage. All this, let it be borne in mind, occurred
before the carriage had entered the grounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Frank recovered his consciousness in the
closet where he was confined, he could not conceive
where he was, or what had befallen him. By slow
degrees the events of the night were recalled to his
recollection, and in great alarm he began to grope
about in the darkness. When he found the door,
and vainly tried to open it, he knocked and shouted
loud and vehemently. The landlord and several
others, astonished at the uproar, hurried to the parlor
and threw open the closet-door. To their rapid and
noisy questioning he could only reply in his own
tongue, which was to them unintelligible. When,
however, by his gestures, the landlord understood
that he complained of ill treatment in his house, he
swore that the stranger must be some robber, who
had concealed himself in the closet, and that some
one in passing had locked the door. Improbable as
was this supposition, in face of the mark of the blow
which Frank exhibited, all present concurred in professing
that they believed it true. A police officer
was accordingly sent for, and the unhappy youth
taken to the guard-house. The next morning he was
summoned before the alcalde, who, too indolent to
send to the frigate to identify the prisoner, and, to do
him justice, wholly discrediting the latter’s statement
of being thrust into the closet, condemned him to be
transported for six months to the Castle St. Juan de
Utloa, off Vera Cruz, the last place held by Spain on
the eastern shore of North America, and next to the
last held by her on the continent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frank was taken immediately on board of a transport
filled with troops and convicts, the first to recruit
the garrison, the last to assist in repairs of the
old, and the construction of additional fortifications.
The youth, although well-grown, it was evident was
not accustomed to, and could not perform manual
labor. The alcalde had therefore sent a message to
the commander of the detachment, recommending
that he should be assigned to some light employment.
The magistrate saw that the youth was a foreigner,
he believed him to be a vagrant if nothing else, and
he knew that hands of all descriptions were needed
at that fortress. He therefore made no inquiries.
That afternoon the transport sailed.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_5'>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Talbot and Mary were successful in reaching the
city unpursued, and had been four days in the American
Consul’s house, before, through his exertions,
they discovered the departure and destination of
Frank Gillespie. The sister was grievously distressed,
and mourned her brother as dead, but Talbot
pledged himself to follow and attempt his rescue, and
although the fractured bone of her arm was not well
knit together, she determined to accompany her
lover as far as she could. Talbot was provoked to
the resolution, to say nothing of a more generous
impulse, by the refusal of the Spanish authorities to
take cognizance of the subject. And Mary felt that
without impropriety she could proceed to some one
of the small ports on the route to Vera Cruz, if not to
the latter place itself. She hired a servant to supply
the place of the one drowned in the <a id='priv'></a>privateer, and
felt more reconciled to the peril to which Talbot
would be exposed, from the assurance of Gonzalez
that he would share the enterprise. The latter, dreading
more assassination by some of the connections of
the late count, than any legal investigation, kept
himself secreted in the city, but was frequently
visited by Talbot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only vessel in port bound in the direction of
Vera Cruz was an American brig, advertised for
Sisal. In her they engaged their passage, and after
night-fall Gonzalez, in disguise, accompanied them
on board. At break-of-day the next morning, they
sailed with a fair wind, and had gained some distance
<span class='pageno' title='293' id='Page_293'></span>
by sunset, when it fell calm, and with the land upon
one side, and an expanse of water on the other,
the vessel rode with graceful ease upon a prolonged
but gentle undulation. The golden rays of the setting
sun mingled in the zenith with the soft and silvery
light of the moon in her meridian, and a long
and lovely twilight followed. Seated on deck, apart
from their companions, (for Gonzalez was too considerate
to intrude,) Mary and her lover mused long
and deeply. The hour and the scene were calculated
to dispel their anxieties and to soothe their cares.
When either was depressed—he, with the sad thought
that of all his race he stood alone—she, that she was
an orphan, and that her brother was perhaps lost to
her forever, a glance around and above would give
their thoughts a holier and more soothing direction;
for the works of the Great Architect, the teeming
earth, the slumbering sea, the brilliant sky, all proclaimed
in language unheard but <span class='it'>felt</span> that mercy is
His great and most peculiar attribute. It was indeed
a lovely scene! Directly overhead, the moon shone
forth in serene and unclouded lustre; a little lower,
the fiery Mars peered forth; then the resplendent orb
of Jupiter, and in the same direct line, but just above
the horizon, the beautiful Venus sunk to rest, enveloped
in a mantle yet rich with the gorgeous rays
of the sun which had preceded her. They remained
on deck until a late hour of the night, for whenever
they went below they were annoyed with the hum
and fretted with the sting of the mosquito. At last
they parted, Talbot throwing himself upon the deck,
and Mary retired to her berth and soon fell asleep.
If the waking hours of that pure-minded girl had
been those of endurance, the visions of that night
were ample compensation. Reclined upon her narrow
bed, with the folds of the mosquito-net tucked
closely around her, while, like the Cossacks before
Ismael, the multitudinous insects strove to enter, she
was either in fancy communing with the man she
loved, or with Frank and her father knelt beneath
the cotton-tree which shaded the grave of her mother,
and listened to the gentle wave as it rippled upon
the beach, while from the jeweled sky, fit canopy,
for such a scene, the Omniscient eye seemed to look
down approving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the crew there was a dandy sailor who
took especial pride in his flowing locks, and evidently
sought to attract the notice of the lady passenger.
The day before they reached Sisal, seizing an opportunity
when Talbot and Gonzales were below, he
passed once or twice by the place where she sat on
deck, and at length catching her eye, with a meaning
look dropped a letter at her feet, and immediately
retired. Mary had been beset with so many dangers
of late; had been so often nearly ensnared by plots,
that she at once imagined the letter to contain a
friendly warning. She therefore hastily picked it
up and ran below. It proved to be a genuine love-letter,
and despite her sadness and the anxiety of her
position, she laughed outright as she read it. Her
unusual merriment drew Talbot to her side, and after
exacting a promise from him that he would in no
manner notice, or betray a knowledge of its contents,
she placed the letter in his hands, saying, “Don’t be
jealous—I will be true, although the offer is a tempting
one.” Verbatim et literatim, it ran thus:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>But love, like faith, comes by inspiration, and
whether it be a milk-maid or a goddess, a man has a
right to worship the object of his affections. As we
have seen, the maiden’s first impulse was to merriment;
but she soon perceived that the man was in
earnest, and from motives of delicacy and compassion
she remained below the remainder of the passage.
The confinement was a brief one. The next
afternoon they reached Sisal, and were hospitably
welcomed by an American merchant, to whom Talbot
had letters from our consul in Havana. Mary
was immediately taken to the gentleman’s house and
cordially greeted by his wife, who insisted upon her
becoming an inmate of the family during her stay.
An offer most gratefully accepted. When the merchant
was told of their contemplated adventure he
became a zealous coadjutor; chartered for them a
small, fast-sailing felucca, and purchased a cargo of
salt, in order that it might be supposed she was on
one of her usual trading voyages. He also procured
for Talbot and Gonzalez, dresses such as are worn
by the crews of these vessels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Determined not to lose a moment, as soon as the
arrangements were completed our adventurers set
sail, Talbot with difficulty tearing himself from his
mistress, who clung to him in all the reckless abandonment
of grief. Coasting along the shore, they
passed Alvarado and anchored the second evening
under Anton Lizardo, until the moon went down.
<span class='pageno' title='294' id='Page_294'></span>
They then lifted their anchor, and passing between
Sacrificios Island (where a Spanish corvette lay) and
the main land, they entered the port of Vera Cruz
unobserved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although necessary for the prosecution of their
plan, yet coming to Vera Cruz, in one contingency,
very much increased their difficulties. It was indispensable
that tidings of their arrival should not
reach the castle, and yet they would certainly be
communicated by the first flag of truce that passed
over. They therefore determined to dispose of their
small cargo at once—lay in a return one, make their
remaining preparations, and with a telescope examine
the works of the castle, to decide on which
point they could with least danger approach, until
near enough to execute the stratagem they had
devised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The south front of the castle, facing the city, was
223 varas, or four hundred and forty yards, including
the south-west and south-east bastions. Along this
front were 34 guns mounted en barbette, i. e., without
embrasures. The south-west curtain was the nearest,
directly facing, and half a mile distant from the town.
Toward the north east, protecting the sea front, was
a tower bastion, which mounted a heavy gun on a
pivot. This tower bastion, nearly triangular in shape,
was completely isolated—its base line being fifty
yards distant from the north-east, or outside curtain
of the castle, with the water flowing between them—as
also between the north-east and north-west faces
of the tower bastion and the outwork—in a space
forty-two feet in width. The outwork itself was
very strongly fortified—indeed the strongest part of
the fortification, as defending the point which, at the
time of its construction, was deemed most likely to
be attacked—as the engineer had not foreseen that
before an attack, the castle and the town might be
separately held by belligerents. The adventurers
determined to make direct for a postern in the south-east
front, where there was a landing of 2 or 3 steps,
leading to a narrow platform, also of stone, which
opened into a covered way. Along the wall, between
the south-west bastion and the postern, were
three or four rings inserted, to which, in time of
peace, vessels were ordinarily made fast, to ride
under the lee of the castle during the terrific gales so
prevalent in the winter months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At an early hour the next morning they started, and
a number of the inhabitants who had heard of their
intention to sail, were gathered on the sea-wall to
see if they could escape both the fire from the castle
and the pursuit of the corvette, then getting under
way from her anchorage at Sacrificios. They cheered
the boat as she left the harbor, and the loud vivas
being heard by the garrison of the castle, several shot
were fired from the south-west bastion, which dispersed
the assemblage. A moment after the little
felucca was seen standing boldly out, and a signal
was made from the castle to the corvette, while
several guns were brought to bear upon the daring
little vessel—for hitherto all attempts to pass had
been made at night. The gunner stood by one
of the guns on the ramparts, and was about to
apply the lighted match, when his movement was
arrested by an officer calling out, “Hold! it is a
friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the felucca was well outside the pier,
she hoisted the Spanish ensign, and with a loud
hurra from Talbot and Gonzalez, stood directly for
the castle. From the ramparts of the town were
instantly heard shouts of execration, and several
muskets were discharged, but without effect, and before
one of the heavy guns could be prepared and
trained, the felucca was close under the walls of the
castle. As supposed deserters, they were received
with apparent cordiality mingled with distrust, and
were conducted forthwith before the commandant,
who interrogated them long and closely. They represented
themselves, Talbot as a merchant whose
property had been confiscated in consequence of his
inability to meet his portion of a forced loan, and
subsequently sent to Xalapa for some remarks he had
made on the tyrannical course of the government.
Gonzalez professed to have been a resident of the
latter town, and that he had long been placed in surveillance
for his political opinions. That with his
companion he had concerted and carried into execution
their plan of escape. The tale seemed plausible,
but the commandant was not thoroughly satisfied, and
although he let them go at large, directed that they
should be strictly watched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boat was made fast to one of the ring-bolts
secured in the wall in the south-east face of the
castle near the postern, and kept in her position by a
line fastened to a light kedge astern. Her bow was
about two fathoms or twelve feet from the landing.
From the surface of the water to the summit-level of
the parapet was about thirty-five feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two friends had feigned to be anxious to get
away, but the commandant withheld his consent,
intending first more thoroughly to satisfy himself of
their character. They rejoiced at the delay, even
while they knew that it exposed them to increased
hazard of detection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Availing themselves of the privilege to wander
about the works, they looked anxiously in every
direction for Frank. In every direction but one they
had looked in vain, and at last, almost in despair,
Talbot approached the quarters of the commandant.
Here, in the last place to have been expected, he
found the object of his search in a kind of open office,
employed in converting into intelligible English some
documents written by an illiterate translator. At the
sight of him Frank started up, and was about to rush
toward him, but resumed his seat when he saw
Talbot place his finger on his lip, and by a gesture
indicated that the sentry who stood near by, was observing
them. On a small shelf just within the door,
stood a can of water, with a drinking-cup beside it.
Talbot stepping quickly within the door-way, asked
the youth in Spanish for a drink of water. The latter,
understanding him, handed the cup, at the same time
closely watching every movement of his friend.
The sentry had in the meantime advanced to the door,
and stood looking in. Talbot drank with seeming
thirst, and returning the cup with a simple “<span class='it'>gratias</span>,”
<span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span>
contrived to slip a bit of paper, unseen, into the
hands of Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, Frank, complaining of the heat, obtained
permission of the officer of the day to sleep
on the south-east bastion, or bastion of St. Crispin,
upon which the land-breeze blew, provided that
he did so under the eye of the sentinel posted
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gonzalez laid himself down at the foot of the stone
stairway or ramp, which led from the court of the
castle below to the parapet above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between 2 and 3 o’clock in the morning, shortly
after the sentinels had been relieved, when the moon
had set, and the light of the stars was intercepted by
masses of clouds wafted over from the land, Talbot,
with his cloak thrown around him, and a cap on his
head, such as were worn by the officers, ascended
the stairway, mounted the parapet, and advanced directly
toward the sentinel near whom Frank had laid
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sentinel, taking it for granted that it was the
officer of the day who approached, (for Talbot had
observed, and now closely imitated his gait,) did not
challenge until the latter was almost within the point
of his bayonet. As he brought his musket to a charge,
demanding the watchword, Talbot pushed the point
of the weapon suddenly aside, and rushing upon,
threw over and fell upon the sentinel. Frank now
sprung up, and found that Talbot held the soldier by
the throat with so much force that he was nearly
strangled. Together they soon securely tied and
gagged him. At a motion from Talbot, who, putting
on the soldier’s cap, and shouldering his musket,
resumed the round, Frank fastened a cord (which the
former threw to him) to one of the barbette-guns, and
let himself down the face of the wall, landing upon
the narrow stone ledge a short distance from the boat.
While he was doing this, Gonzalez had stealthily
crawled up the ramp or stairway, and creeping along
the parapet, in like manner, lowered himself down
beside the youth. Talbot then placing the musket
by the gun, with the soldier’s cap upon, and his cloak
around it, followed their example, and reached his
companions in safety. One of them then swam out
and cut the rope which held the boat by the stern,
but, on his return, found his companions in consternation.
A padlock had been put upon the chain, and
in vain they strove to part the bolt. At this moment
the clouds had swept by, and they were thrown into
despair by hearing the sentinel on the south-west
bastion call out, “<span class='it'>Qui viv</span>.” In desperation they
all sprung into the boat as the sentinel discharged his
musket, and gave the alarm. With the strength
which despair alone can give, they seized the chain,
and with one mighty effort tore the bolt from the
stern of the boat with a crash. The alarm was now
general, and there was not an instant to be lost.
Pushing boldly from the landing, they hoisted their
sail with expedition, and stood diagonally across toward
the main land, carefully keeping themselves in
a line with the angle of the south-east bastion. There
was great confusion in the garrison, several of the
large guns were discharged, and volleys of musketry
were fired in the direction they pursued. The balls
flew wide of the mark, and as the felucca was now
under rapid headway, they began to congratulate
themselves that they were out of danger, when, by a
discharge of the heavy pivot-gun on the tower-bastion,
loaded with grape, Gonzalez was struck
down, mortally wounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The felucca reached Sisal in safety, but Talbot and
Mary deeply and unceasingly mourned the loss of
their true and invaluable friend. And Frank bitterly
grieved that his freedom should have been purchased
at such a sacrifice. He was, indeed, worthy of all
regret—but a cloud had overshadowed his sun of
life. He would have brooded over his sister’s shame
until existence had become a burthen, and his impulsive
nature might by unlawful means have sought
relief in the cold embrace of death. He perished
in a work of charity, and it is to be hoped that
He who,</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>in His abounding mercy, forgave one act of passion
for the redeeming merits of the cause wherein the
unhappy Gonzalez met his death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was only one vessel at Sisal, bound at an early
day to the United States, and her destination was New
Orleans. Frank, his sister and Talbot, accordingly
took passage in her, and reached the south-west pass
of the Mississippi just as a gale was coming on.
The country above had been overflowed by recent
heavy rains, and what between the current from
within, and the swell without, they were greeted
with a magnificent spectacle. The waves of the
gulf, driven before the gale, which had soon become
terrific, encountered the onward sweep of the waters
of the mighty river. The sight forcibly reminded
them of Rebecca’s exclamation in Ivanhoe, “God of
Jacob! it is like the meeting of two oceans moved by
adverse tides!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly the whole period of their stay was embraced
in one uninterrupted storm, but the magnificence
of the scenery compensated for the inclemency
of the weather. Vegetation was still in
full luxuriance, and the moss, pendent from the trees,
and saturated with incessant rain, like dripping garments
swayed to and fro in the wind, while low,
rugged clouds trailed along but a short distance overhead,
and a gray semi-transparent mist floated above
the surface of the ground. The “Mississippi,” unusually
turbid, and swollen to the utmost capacity of
its banks, with its mighty whirls and eddies, rushed
impetuously on, bearing on its surface many a vestige
of the devastation it had caused. Nor were the
works of art, clumsy and unsymmetrical though
they were, wanting to the scene, spreading no sail
to the breeze, but drifting idly with the current,
the arks and the broad-horns were whirled by
with a rapidity that seemed to defy management.
Wafted over the water frequently came the wild and
not unmelodious sound of the bugle, while in the
stillness of the night were heard the manly and sonorous
voices of the boatmen singing,</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>Steam was just beginning to be introduced, and the
soothing solitudes of nature to be disturbed by the
monotonous clank of machinery. Our party availed
themselves of an upward-bound steamboat, and slowly
ascended the Mississippi, whose turbid and swollen
waters rolled far and wide beyond their usual boundaries.
The river was filled with broken rafts, drift
logs, and half-sunken and floating trees. The danger
of running upon a snag, or encountering a sawyer,
was great and impending. The current was so strong
that their boat, although striving to keep in shore,
would frequently be caught by a whirl or an eddy,
and like a stray leaf upon a rivulet, would be turned
round and round until striking against a tree, it would
be sent into the mid current and again be carried for
miles among the trees, from whose verdant tops the
birds that had remained undisturbed by the rush and
the roar beneath, flew at the boat’s approach, as if
aware that their only enemy was man. They also
ascended the Ohio, whose limpid waters, gliding with
a strong but not impetuous current, have won for it
the name of beautiful. When they stood upon the
crest of the Alleghany, and saw mountains, “hills
and plains as graceful in their sweep as the arrested
billows of a mighty sea, and recollected that more
boundless than the view, that verdant sweep is uninterrupted
until the one extreme is locked in the fast
embrace of thick-ribbed ice, and the other is washed
by the phosphorescent ripple of the tropic, while on
either side is heard the murmuring surge of a widespread
and magnificent ocean,”<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> their hearts bounded
with exultation as they thought of the unrivaled destinies
of their country. As if on the high altar of the
land of his nativity, Talbot, who had wandered far
and wide, could not withhold his pledge of devotion,
and the heartfelt exclamation escaped him,</p>

<p class='pindent'>The commissioned officer, not unknown to fame,
met with none of the obstacles which the friendless
orphan had encountered, and Talbot’s estate was
settled without difficulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the chastening hand of time had hallowed
the memories of the dead, and substituted a Christian
resignation for the bitterness of early grief, Edward
and Mary were united, and through a since much
checkered life, neither time nor circumstance, nor
prosperity, nor distress, has for one instant abated
a feeling which is fixed and unalterable as their
future destinies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Paris, on the 28th of February last, about
four o’clock in the afternoon, a rainbow was distinguished
in the heavens. “Bravo!” cried a workman
of the Faubourg Saint Antoine—“See how le
bon Dieu (the good God) also acknowledges the
French Republic—he hangs out the tricolored flag.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This anecdote, though singularly French, who are
noted for irreligion, does not strike me as betraying
any lack of reverence. Could not the poor <span class='it'>ouvrier</span>
in his ignorance really have presumed the rainbow
to be a providential token? Instances of greater
blindness might be recounted, which have happened
at our own doors. Who does not know the stories
of Millerite fanaticism? Are not the impostures of
Matthias too recent not to be remembered in detail?
The miracles which they pretended, and which were
not too monstrous for the capacious maw of respectable
credulity, were much more marvelous than
the tricolored flag of the poor Paris laborer.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_8'>VI.—SHIPWRECK.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>There is no event, by which sorrow is brought to
mankind, which arouses in the mind of old and young
a livelier horror than “shipwreck.” There is something
so terrible in the loneliness and obscurity of
the sea, something so deplorable in the utter helplessness
of the sailors, that there is scarcely any danger
which we would not rather encounter. When
we read of one, either near at hand or afar off, we
involuntarily close our eyes, as if to shut out the
awful scene; the noble ship helplessly reeling and
tumbling on the billows, the pall of clouds, the driving
rain, the white spray and foam drifting like
ghosts over the water, some boat perhaps crowded
with human beings, some broken mast or spar to
which cling drowning wretches, and alone, all alone
on the ocean-desert, with no hope of aid or succor.
Vainly do we strive to shut our ears to the cries of
misery and despair, to the wail of the wind, the loud
lamenting of the surge, the deep groans of the vessel
as her timbers part, and the noblest fabric of human
skill is about to be torn to fragments and utterly
destroyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Byron, describing a ship under full sail, uses
the forcible expression,</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“She walks the water like a thing of like.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>There is as much truth as beauty in this. Indeed it
is difficult to imagine so proud and glorious an object,
moving obedient to reason and command, to be nothing
more than an inanimate mass. Behold her, as
she sets out upon her voyage, with a fair sky and
favoring breeze! How gracefully she parts the
waters and sweeps onward! Is not that form instinct
with feeling and endowed with intellect? No!
she is but a wonderful piece of mechanism; but the
dullest fancy might imagine her a being, an intelligence,
capable of volition, powerful in deed. Observe
her, too, when overmastered by the tempest
and made subject to the waves, she drifts powerless
along! Does she not seem to suffer human pangs
in her struggles, and to die with all of mortal agony?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attachment, I might say friendship, which
seamen entertain for particular vessels is not to be
wondered at. The deck is the home of the mariner:
here the greater number of his days are spent: the
masts, sails, rigging are to him familiar objects, the
objects of his constant care and solicitude, and he
feels for them a species of paternal love. When
these are destroyed, lost, wrecked, he mourns them
with a real sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is my lot to live within constant sight of the sea.
I am on one of the grand highways from Europe to
New York. Ships of all nations pass my door.
Many a noble vessel has been wrecked within a
mile from my dwelling. My mind therefore often
reverts to this most fearful calamity, and it is difficult
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span>
for me to expel even from my dreams visions of
shipwreck.</p>

sort—none of your meager outlines—your skeletons
of sketches—but the rotund figures in full of
the veritable hero of that glorious poem, and all the
scenes and adventures through which he passed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Darling old Dr. Syntax! How many a sad, long
year has droned away since I, a merry boy, used to
read thy most fascinating of Tours! Nothing ever
so captivated my young imagination as thy solitary
rambles on thy faithful steed through town and hamlet—now
taking up thy abode with some lordly proprietor,
and now sleeping contentedly beneath the
roof of some sturdy yeoman—now kissing the
squire’s wife and sister, and now giving sympathizing
advice to the dairy-maid, who was, like poor
Ophelia, disappointed in love. Oh, Doctor! thou
wast never above humanity. Though never frail
thyself, yet wast thou no inexorable judge over the
frailties of others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I long, most patient and peculiar of travelers, I
long sincerely to accompany thee once more in thy
rambles. Most charitable of divines, most lenient of
pedagogues, “take thee for all in all, I shall not
look upon thy like again!” <span class='it'>Interestingest</span> of all
authors, I would enter into thy feelings once more.
I would feel the joy thou feltest in quitting thy
spouse (no <span class='it'>dulcis uxor</span>) and mounting thy famous
mare, Grizzle, and setting forth on thy most speculative
and picturesque expedition. You were a
creature of the brain, Doctor, I suppose—but to me
you are a reality. I remember you perfectly. I
loved you when a boy at school with all my heart.
<a id='orth'></a>Orthography, Etymology and Prosody I hated—but
I loved Syntax.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Which of you generous and gentlemenly booksellers
will immediately send me a copy (bound or unbound,

Tour in Search of the Picturesque? Speak not all

the Boston Post.” It would afford me “a wonderful

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_10'>VIII.—A CHARACTER.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>My friend, Ralph Willinton, is a man of adventures.
More strange things have happened to him
than to any dozen people I ever heard of, in what
are called “the common walks of life.” Ralph is
by no means an extraordinary individual. If the
North River waited for him to set it on fire, it might
flow on through the Highlands unscorched forever.
He was not born to greatness; he will never achieve
greatness, nor will greatness be thrust upon him.
But do not misunderstand me: Ralph, as the gentleman
felicitously remarked of Shakespeare, “is no
fool.” On the contrary, he is a fellow of parts.
He never dazzled in conversation by a coruscation
of mother-wit; but when he has heard a happy rejoinder,
he remembers it, and has the skill to use it
to advantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ralph is the happiest mimic in these <span class='it'>Untied</span> States,
as they may sooner or later be called. There never
appeared an actor in any one of our theatres whose
voice and manner he cannot imitate with marvelous
verisimilitude. Moreover he sings a very good song,
though with no very powerful or melodious voice.
He can write Magazine articles on music, composes
occasionally himself, and writes love ditties, such as
they are. Add to these accomplishments a manner
irresistibly winning, and tones in speaking as sweet
as those which the author of Guy Mannering gives
to Rashleigh Osbaldistone, and you are possessed of
the sum total of Ralph’s recommendations. The
sum total do I say? when I have but obscurely
hinted at his extraordinary gift or faculty of story-telling,
by which, like Hamlet’s Yorick, he can set
the whole table on a roar. In sooth, he is the most
diverting of dinner-table companions. He richly
earns his invitations, of which no man has more.
You can bear to listen to those stories of his (which
are nothing when any one else tells them) a hundred
times. They are “ever charming, ever new.” Age
cannot mar nor custom stale his infinite variety.
His profession is the law, and his practice is amusement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ralph is, in fine, a capital fellow. It is a pity
that he should have a capital propensity. He is the
hero of all his romances. Had he been Macbeth,
he never would have exclaimed, “Thou canst not
say <span class='it'>I</span> did it!” He would rather have had the <span class='it'>credit</span>
of murdering Duncan himself than have been thought
to have no hand in the “bloody business.” Ralph
is the most ubiquitous of mortals. To have effected
an iota of what he attributes to his own talents,
valor and industry, to have done one in fifty of those
deeds of which he asserts “<span class='it'>quorum pars magna
fui</span>,” he must have been in a very considerable
number of places at once. Nevertheless and notwithstanding
Ralph Willinton is a glorious good
fellow. Reader, did you ever meet with Ralph
Willinton?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In summer time there are few things more delightful
than an occasionally wet day to “out-of-towners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we of the country, in our almost noiseless
homes, may delight and rejoice in the strange and
pleasant quietness attending a still, steadily-falling
rain; we can watch with admiring eyes how the fields
and the well-draperied woods grow bright and cleanly,
’neath the hand of that pattern housekeeper, Dame
Nature; we can listen undisturbed by the multitudinous
noises which infest a city, to the dear wild-birds,
who, impatient of the long-continued weeping
of the skies, occasionally break forth into the merriest
songs, as if questioning each other as to how they
stand the charges of the elements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then there is the generous Sun King, (I acknowledge,
however, he does not shine for country-people
<span class='it'>only</span>,) glancing out at intervals from between
the heavy clouds, smiling upon us joyously, and
looking for all the world as though he would say if
he could, “never mind, children, the storm will soon
be passed!” And then the after-part of a summer
shower! the freshened fragrance of the flowers—the
purified atmosphere—the bright blue sky—the increased
glory of the setting-sun—the rainbow in the
east—the drops of water glistening on the flowers
and on the grass, so pure and bright, that one might
almost imagine them the tears of spirits—the glad
songs of innumerable birds—the groups of children
exhibiting in various ways their nautical daring on
and about the newly-formed lakelets in the roads and
fields—the many evidences of life awakened out of
doors—then the holy calmness of the ensuing summer
night—the soft light of the stars—and after that
the trembling glory of the new moon! Oh, beautiful,
beautiful summer! with thy rain-storms and thy sunshine,
hasten to us again!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But—a rainy day in winter! its horrors encircle
me at this moment; I forbear entering into its details.
However much <span class='it'>you</span> may delight in a day like unto
this, oh, listen to the humble voice now emerging
from the way-side, <span class='it'>I</span> have no courage to speak even
of the stubborn, hard-headed, cheerless figure Nature
presents when she stands gazing in such mute dismay
upon her domicil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is in human nature, at least in mine, and I claim
to be human, to be always looking for <span class='it'>a something
better</span>, and despite all this dreariness without, my
heart is even now continually singing, “Spring is
coming! spring is coming!” but a few weeks! and
then, instead of the dismal trappings of winter, how
beautiful and bright all without and around us will
be! the very thought is enough to make every soul
shout, “Hasten the time! Amen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is such a desolateness in the court of the
white-headed old king which people very naturally
shrink from as they grow older in years!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking back into childhood, these stony-hearted
months when frost and snow reign king and queen
over earth, seem, indeed, the most joyous—and not
without reason. For then the “Christman” and the
youth so full of promise, the bright New Year, are
never-failing guests by the mid-winter fire-side.
There is joy for the child on the ice-bound hill, on
the glassy, frozen lake, in the gurgling, merry sound
of the sleigh-bells, in the sight of the cheerful home-fire,
in the bracing out-door air, in the huge snow-drifts—everywhere,
everywhere there is joy for the
child!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And why? Because of bounding hopes and joyous
dreams, and the careless yielding up of oneself to
every passing enjoyment—because of freedom from
labor—because of ignorance of the worth and supremacy
of gold—because of utter innocence of the
strict “proprieties” of life! There is joy for the child,
because he has not yet learned much of disappointments;
he does not know how uncomfortable is the
close-fitting garment of manhood. He is not wise
enough to see in the winter storms, in the driving
blasts in which he so much delights, the type of what
assuredly awaits him. He does not know that the
life-storms with which he will have to struggle, will
come suddenly and furiously upon him—that he will,
perforce, then fling aside his mittens and grapple open
handed with his foes. And it must certainly be at the
warm and genial hearth-fire of truth and honesty, and
no stifling stove-heat by which he must keep his heart,
and its hopes and affections warm and in health, else
they will die away suddenly and utterly, even as the
fire of the “patent air-tight” dies!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hark! now I hear the flapping of wings; and lo,
here, almost close beside my window, are passing
pigeons—snow-white pigeons; and, where <span class='it'>could</span> it
have streamed from, there is a ray of sunlight on
their wings! and since I have begun writing, the
clouds seem to have “spent their fury,” they are
less dull and dreary—they are slowly breaking away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The view from the window by which I am writing
is not especially charming. In one direction there
are sheds, and barns, and barren trees, and a little
farther on, the spire of an unpretending church, and
<span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span>
sundry chimney-tops, together with the roofs of a few
loftier buildings meet my eye. These are all certainly
very <span class='it'>suggestive</span> scenes, and might make so
many important heads of a very interesting discourse;
but, in another direction from this same window there
are great fields, and farther on, woods and hills, and
between them and me, there are two points in the
landscape on which very often my eyes rest, and
many are the recollections, bitter and sweet, they
awaken. One is a village school-house, the other a
thickly-populated grave-yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over those hills, and through the woods, and by
the sandy shores of our beautiful lake, I was once a
frequent wanderer, and with me invariably in all
those rovings, was a child of somewhere near my
own age, to whom, good reader, you may now consider
yourself introduced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the week, with its disappointments, and
hopes and joys has passed, and Saturday afternoon,
the child’s holyday the world over, comes round
again, how often my thoughts have turned back to
her, and to the time when <span class='it'>we</span> also were young; oh,
how much of meaning there is in that word, <span class='it'>youth</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But looking back into the past is not an over-pleasant
business at any time. There are very many
reasons why people, for the most part, dread the
rolling up of that curtain within which lies buried
much of destroyed confidence, and happiness that
died of fearful wounds; but I am willing to trespass
on my own feelings at this present, that you may
know something of Lily Reeve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>People said she was a genius. They said rightly—she
was. And to complete the interest attachable
to her therefor, Lily was poor—<span class='it'>very</span> poor, and had
been all the days of her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Reeve family moved among us they had
no acquaintance or relative in our village—and their
circumstances and business were not such as attached
any importance or attracted any notice to them.
Had it not been for Lily they would probably have
remained long enough in our midst, unknown and
uncared for. The mother was a middle-aged woman,
a widow; of the children I knew not much, save that
with much appropriateness their name might have
been “legion.” Lily was the eldest child—not
beautiful—and far from being even interesting,
personally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why her parents had bestowed on her so decided
a name as Lily was always a mystery—for very far
from a resemblance, even the slightest, to that graceful
flower, was she. Neither was she a brunette,
but of complexion rather dark, hair <span class='it'>very</span> black, and
always curled, which gave her a decidedly Mrs.
Hemanish look at times. Her features were irregular—oh,
certainly, she was <span class='it'>far</span> from beautiful, and yet
there was much sweetness of expression in the
mouth, and much of vigor and determination perceivable
in her dark eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a good many years ago, but I remember
distinctly the first time I ever saw Lily. With a
number of juveniles I was returning from a <span class='it'>very</span>
long walk—all our foot-jaunts were long in those
days—when, on passing by an old-fashioned frame-house,
brown with age, and poor and disconsolate in
its outward appearance, one of the group said, “Let’s
go into that house; there’s a girl living there who
paints.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And we went in. One of the more confident of
our number said to the woman who received us,
“Will you show us some of the pictures your
daughter has painted?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a smile of satisfaction, as though she were
pleased that even we children should have heard of
her daughter, the woman bade us sit down; and then
she brought from an old chest a handful of papers,
and spread them on the table before us. Some of
these were pictures of warriors on their steeds, others
landscapes, and some were heads. There was one
which more than all the others attracted my attention—it
was a portrait of a sleeping child. We asked
if this were one of her children, or only a fancy
sketch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was her little brother who died,” replied the
woman, with a sigh. “Lily drew it when he was
dead.” There was something so sad in the mother’s
voice as she said this, that it checked our gay spirits,
and tended to subdue our loud expressions of admiration.
While we yet stood there turning over the
papers, and gazing in wonder on the productions of a
girl no older than the youngest among us, the subject
of our thoughts and curiosity came into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she saw what was our object there, she
came up to the table, and putting her arm around
me, as though confident she was with friends, she
asked if we liked her drawings. I remember well
the thrill which passed over me at this simple act of
hers, for I had begun to regard the girl as something
quite extraordinary, and almost more than human.
From that day I date a friendship I am proud to have
formed, one which, while it lasted, delighted me more
than any similar tie I have ever known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was very easy to see that the heart of the mother
in those days was full of hope—that the mind of the
daughter teemed with ambitious desires, and a determination,
apparently invincible, to accomplish
great things. About that time there were many
people who turned prophets, and looking into the
future, they saw a great name added to America’s
illustrious daughters of song—the name of Lily
Reeve. Do you think their prophecy has proved
true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the old school-house, (which I heartily regret to
say has been of late abandoned, and its former inmates
have taken possession of a more stately edifice
up-town,) in that little old brick building, <span class='it'>we</span> in the
years long, long gone by, were wont to assemble—and
Lily joined us there. And although on the
humdrum route of <span class='it'>learning</span> we were quite in the
advance, she soon very far outstripped us, and
moved on with most rapid strides through all the
first branches of education. It was impossible for us
dullards to see her strange advancement, and not
feel a little envious of her ability, notwithstanding
we liked Lily so well. In one short year she had
acquired nearly all the instruction it was possible for
our teacher to impart, and as may be supposed for
<span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span>
his part, he was watching her progress with somewhat
of anxiety. But his honor as a teacher was
not destined to be sacrificed to the young girl’s
genius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One afternoon, when school was dismissed, Lily
said to me, “You and I will go home by the other
street. I have something to tell you, and the way
will be longer. Besides, I want to be away from
these rough boys and girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So we crossed the road, and entered a path which
led us by a long way home. When we had reached
the bridge, which crossed a deep, rapidly running
brook, we sat down on the bench, placed in the shade
of an old tree, which from “time immemorial” has
stood there, with the most of its tangled roots buried
in the water; then Lily spoke again, for the first
time since we went out from the school-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know they are going to send me to the
other school—they think I can learn more there, and
have teachers in the higher branches, and in the
languages. Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why that ‘oh, dear!’ Lily? I only wish I
were ready to go there too, but I am such an ignoramus,
and you know every thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite every thing. I <span class='it'>should</span> be glad to go—and
there are a great many reasons why. I have the
greatest desire to learn, and I’m sure if I have a
little more education, I can make my way easily in
the world; but—but—in short, they are rich people
who are going to send me, and they will expect
miracles from me, you may depend upon it—<span class='it'>I</span> know.
Because I am poor, and can write pretty well, and
paint, and sketch likenesses, they have taken an
interest in me; but I tell you before hand, and you
will see before long I speak rightly; I shall have to
work like a slave to keep up with their expectations.
Isn’t it enough to make any body say, ‘oh, dear?’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—I don’t think so, Lily. You <span class='it'>can’t help</span>
equaling their expectations, and they have such nice
teachers at the other school, and no great rude boys
go there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That makes no difference at all. One can learn
as well in one place as another. If it were not that
mother felt so glad when the ladies made her the
offer to send me there, I’d never go. You don’t
know any thing about what it means to be dependent;
you can’t think what a heavy load seems resting
on me, ever since so many people have seemed to
take an interest in me. I really begin to doubt my
own powers. It seems to me as though I ought not
to be forced like a plant in a hot-bed. I almost wish
I never had any particular gifts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you say this, Lily Reeve, when all the girls
in town are envying you! Now just be firm, for
I’m sure if you only make up your mind you <span class='it'>will</span>
do a thing, you <span class='it'>can</span> do it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you believe it?” she asked, so suddenly, that
I was startled and began in some trepidation to bethink
my words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” I answered at last; “I heard our
minister say the other day your verses were excellent;
and you know your pictures sold well at the
fair. How can you doubt yourself so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said Lily, thoughtfully, “perhaps
they are nearer right than I dare to think them—but
I cannot explain it to you. I am never satisfied with
any thing I do. My verses always sound so rough
when compared with the melody in my brain—and
my pictures, when I begin them, my fingers almost
fly, I think I will surpass myself—and when they are
finished, they always look so rude and rough, that
I am tempted often to burn them every one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind,” said I, confidently, “you will
see the day yet when all will be brighter to you—and
you know the teacher says every day ‘practice
makes perfect;’ and he always looks at you when
he says it—you ought to have learned that by this
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll learn it now from you,” said Lily; “we’ll
go now to the woods, I want to get some flowers to
take to mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just beyond the woods to which we then bent our
steps, there was a large field, in the upper portion of
which, early in the season, we always found multitudes
of purple flowers and white lilies; our first
business that night was to fill our aprons with these
treasures, and then we went into the woods, and sat
down by a stream in a most romantic place, and
began to arrange our huge bunches of flowers. Lily
made hers into small bouquets, one for each of her
family, while I twined mine into a wreath, and laid
it on her head. But soon the fast increasing shade
in the woods warned us it was time to be returning
home. The thought of the obligation she was about
to incur evidently still troubled my companion’s
mind, for she spoke but little, and her words, when
she did speak, were desponding, and even the bright
flowers with which her hands were filled, failed to
attract her usual attention, or awaken the delight
they were wont to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were about crossing the stile that was placed
at the entrance of the wood, when Lily suddenly
flung the beautiful green moss she had gathered in a
damp place, with violence from the bosom of her
dress, where she had laid it. And when I looked
with amazement at the excited girl, she exclaimed,
“Look there! I had a snake in my bosom!” Truly
enough, there was a tiny, striped, infant snake,
creeping out leisurely from the bunch of moss she
had flung upon the ground. A thought darted through
my mind—I grasped her arm and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall hear the moral of this before you go a
step further, Lily Reeve. I’m no genius, but I’ll
teach you a plain lesson. You have thrown the snake
away from you; don’t, don’t ever take it back again.
Don’t doubt those who mean to do you kindness;
only just do what nature intended you should, and all
who know you will be satisfied! When you come
to be very famous, the people who help you now
will think you did them a favor in letting them aid
you. Mother says perseverance will work wonders,
and I believe it—<span class='it'>you</span> can prove it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I had finished my oration, I stood somewhat
astonished at my own audacity, but after a moment’s
silence Lily said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you—thank you, for you have learned
<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>
me two lessons—I’ll not forget them; no, I will never
take the serpent back, you may depend on that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days after Lily was established at the larger
school, dwelling with other boarders in the family of
the principal, the wonder of all the scholars, and the
pet pupil with the teachers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hopeful expectations of her family were kept
up by her progress, and by her own increasing courage
and cheerfulness. And in reality it seemed no unfounded
expectation, that which they cherished, that
the young girl would soon be able to support them
all by dint of her genius. Her efforts became daily
more worthy and more promising, now that she
possessed these superior advantages; fortune seemed
really determined to work good things for the rich
peoples’ <span class='it'>protégé</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lily was not yet seventeen, but her poems had
many of them attracted much attention; injudicious
praises were lavished upon her; by their attentions
and flattery, the proud, and the rich, and the learned
seemed to have conspired to spoil a girl—a school-girl—poor
“from her youth up.” They did not take
it into consideration that it was quite possible for
them to raise her hopes and self-appreciativeness
too high; they did not give heed to the fact that it
might require years of struggling and disappointment
for her to produce any thing worthy the reward and
honor they would fain believe were rightfully hers
even then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But soon enough they had cause to regret this
course they adopted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A change came o’er the spirit of her dream.”
Self-confidence rapidly usurped the place of a befitting
humility, which had once characterized her.
Instead of comparing herself with the great masters
of song and painting, Lily seemed to think that in
outstripping all her schoolmates, and in being considered
a prodigy among teachers, she was rapidly
filling the measure of her greatness; and the laudations
which good-will prompted others to speak,
instead of being listened to and valued at their worth,
came at last to be considered as quite true and well-deserved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is said that more strength of mind is requisite to
bear composedly a sudden <span class='it'>favorable</span> turn of fortune
than is necessary calmly to endure reverses. Having
never had occasion to test the truth of the proposition,
I, of course, have only a right to <span class='it'>suppose</span>
there is somewhat “more of truth than poetry” in
the idea; at all events, that is a very easy way to
account for Lily’s derelictions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the wish of her “patrons,” as well as of the
kind lady teacher to whose care she was chiefly commended,
that Lily should finish the course of studies
apportioned to each scholar previous to graduating.
But there was a growing willfulness, an increasing
confidence in her own attainments, that tempted her
to set at naught these desires. Her impulsive nature
longed to be free from restraint; she would fain throw
aside all bondage, together with the loathed idea of
dependence, and labor for herself in the way she
was best fitted to labor. She wished to begin <span class='it'>at once</span>
to reap the reward of her years of study, and thus to
alleviate the wants of her home. Alas! the serpent
had crept back into Lily’s breast!</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, despite all the remonstrances and the pleadings
of those who began to see their mistake in their
dealings with the young girl, Lily left the school, and
returned to her own home. I shall never forget her
as she was at that time; the passions, hopes, desires
and resolution of mature years seemed to have even
then a full development in her. In feeling she had
grown too old, in will too decisive, to submit patiently
to the judgment of other minds. But soon
enough the lesson was forced upon her that poetic
efforts are rarely capable of being changed at once
for food, and fuel, and raiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have sent a poem of some length to —— ——,”
she said to me one day, naming a distinguished
writer and editor, “and you know I am superstitious—if
he accepts it, and will pay me for it, I shall take
it as a good omen for my future; but if he does not—”
she hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if he does not, Lily?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then those horrid doubts will come back to me
with renewed force! Oh, they tormented me so
once!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I saw my friend again there was no need
to ask her what her reception at the “editor’s table”
had been. It was a freezing cold winter night, and
feeling somewhat disconsolate on my own account,
as well as rather curious in regard to Lily’s progress,
I sought her in her own home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found Lily there seated at the centre-table—yes,
it was such, for it did occupy the central portion of
the apartment—but it was not of polished mahogany,
or marble-surfaced, gentle reader, but a miserable,
old, broken affair, that had seen its best days long
before it came into the possession of its then owners.
Scattered about the room were the numerous boys
and girls of the family; there was little temptation
even for the boys without that night, it was so cold
and stormy. The room in which they lived was
the upper story of a small building, the first floor of
which was occupied as a mechanic’s shop; it was
partitioned by a curtain of cloth, which was all the
separation between the sleeping apartments and the
place where they cooked, and ate, and lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a deep silence in the room when I
entered. Lily was occupied with her drawing,
lighted by two tapers burning in a cup half-filled with
oil. There was none of that cheerful hope beaming
in her fine eyes that usually filled them when she
welcomed me. And all the faces in the room looked
doleful enough—some rebuff they had certainly met
with from some quarter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am drawing this for you,” she said, when I sat
down beside her and looked at her work, “it is for a
parting gift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parting!” I exclaimed; “what are you going to
do now, were you successful in your letter to
Mr. ——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Read it and see,” she said, producing a letter,</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Miss Reeve.</span>—Dear Madam,—Your favor was
many days ago received, and now, at my first leisure,
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>
I hasten to reply. I regret that an answer similar to
that given to many applicants during every week
must also be returned to you. I regret this the more,
because your communications show talent, but—you
need much practice; and, permit me to say, a
writer must usually have acquired <span class='it'>some reputation</span>
before he can receive any ‘golden rewards.’ If you
are necessitated to labor, I would advise you that
there are many ways less vexatious, and more certain
as to their issue, in which you might successfully
employ yourself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I retain the MS. subject to your orders.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“Respectfully, etc.,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“—— ——.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was with difficulty I could repress my grief, as
I looked about that cheerless room, and on the young
girl whose disappointment I knew must be so keen;
but calmly, and apparently undisturbed, Lily continued
her drawing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will you do now, Lily?” I asked, anxious
to at least break the embarrassing silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are going west next week!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“West! where—how?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Illinois. I have borrowed the money—we
cannot stay here and starve. I am going there
to take a school. If I cannot get a living by
writing, there <span class='it'>are</span> many other ways—and I will try
them at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had she told me her immediate intention of taking
a journey to the South Pole, I should have felt my
powers of credulity very little more taxed than they
were at that moment, so wild and perfectly impracticable
seemed the scheme. But Lily had spoken so
seriously, and with so much determination, I was
constrained to believe her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The picture she was engaged upon—I have it yet—was
an imaginative and a striking one. It was a
moonlight scene. Beside the water’s edge, among
wild rocks, a girl was standing alone—the figure was
a likeness of herself—and a very perfect one it was,
too. The <span class='it'>expression</span> of the sketch was touching in
the extreme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is looking for peace and rest there,” said
Lily, in explanation. “She has sought it so often,
but has not found it—and she never will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does she seek it in the right way, Lily?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. Every thing seems changed to
me of late. I am bewildered. It seems to me as
though I had lost myself. Since that letter came I
doubt my powers more than ever. To think of one
in my situation having to <span class='it'>practice</span> before I can work
successfully! There is little time to practice, I think,
when eight human beings are wondering where their
next meal is to come from—when their wood-yard
is in such a state of depression and emptiness as
ours is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mother sighed heavily as Lily said this, but
did not speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you certainly can do something here,” I
cried. “Don’t go and bury yourself in the back-woods.
I’m sure you can be a teacher in our school
if you’ll only ask. It’s perfectly wild in you to think
of going this winter! traveling, you know, at this
time of year is a very costly business, dear Lily,
besides being so cheerless!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no use talking about it; I should have
loved to live here, for my own part, all my life, but
I have engaged a school in the town we are going to,
and they wish it to be opened early in the spring.
There’s no help for it—we must go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that day until within a few months I heard
nothing in regard to the Reeve Family. Lily had
promised to tell us her experience in the west, of
her success in this new attempt at securing a livelihood;
but her promise was unfulfilled, and we could
not but fear lest despondency had utterly crushed all
the aspirations of her genius, that if she yet lived,
poverty and hopelessness had come to be her only
portion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, though her name had never reached us through
the medium talents like hers choose for their utterance—the
press—there was always with me a lingering
hope and belief that Lily had, under some assumed
name, made herself famous. Knowing so well her
ability, the more I thought of this the more I became
strongly convinced that it was so. At last, when I
had dreamed of her night after night, and thought
much of her in my waking hours, it became absolutely
necessary to my own peace of mind that I
should write to her once more—a thing I had not
done in many years—in order to discover if she
were actually dead or alive—famous or unknown to
the world. It was with much anxiety, as all my
lady readers will believe, I awaited her reply—for an
answer I felt convinced I should receive. It came
at last; and as people such as she are regarded by
the world as a species of public property, as regards
their thoughts, words, and deeds, I have little scruples
in laying Lily’s epistle open for public inspection,
knowing that her words will awaken the hope and
renewed efforts of the despairing, and excite the admiration
and commendation of all good people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have but just received your letter, dear friend
of by-gone days, and believe me, it has given me no
little satisfaction to think that you remember me, and
with interest still. I am inclined to laugh, and
weep, and wonder, when I think of myself as I was
in the days long ago, when we lived among you so
very poor and dependent; but there is a feeling of
gratitude living in my heart stronger than every other
emotion now excited in my breast by the freshened
remembrance of my old home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ask me to tell you what I have been doing,
and wish to know under what name I have immortalized
myself. You will not believe I left behind
me all my ambitious desires when we made our
abode here in the west! Have you ever chanced to
hear of ——? It is the name I chose to adopt in my
appearance before the public. Perhaps you may
have seen it, and read verses accompanying it, but I
am confident you never recognized in those merry
strains the voice and the heart-tune of your once
poverty-stricken and desponding friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(The reader may imagine my astonishment and
amaze on reading these words—for my correspondent,
<span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span>
Lily Reeve, was none other than one of the most
beloved and popular of writers!)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel conversational to-day, besides, I know it
is but just to assure those who were so generous in
my days of adversity, that their money and sympathy
were not altogether thrown away. I was very far
from being forgetful of those who in my earlier years
rendered me such efficient and valuable aid; but I
thought it better even at the risk of being esteemed
ungrateful, to be unknown to them and to you, until
I should be able to reflect some little credit upon
them. I shall soon publish a book which is dedicated
to those friends of former days, through that I hope
to relieve myself from any charge of forgetfulness
or coldness they may have justly brought against me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is only ten years since we first made our home
in this western world; but I have grown gray in
feeling since then, and looking back into my childhood,
the road to it seems to be one of interminable
length. Decidedly as our fortunes have brightened,
we have had our struggles and heart-sorrows here
also; and we have had much of sickness too, which
seems to await almost every settler in the west; but
there is so much more for which we have occasion
to be thankful, that it seems almost a sin even to
revert to our first trials and vexations. My mother,
thank Heaven! now that she is old, may rest; her
latter years are not harassed with the thoughts of a
dependent, impoverished family; my brothers are in
a way, all of them, to support themselves, and my
young sisters are being educated in such a way that
they will never have to rely on others for their support.
And for all this I pray we may be ever thankful
as we ought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When we first came to this place all things were
decidedly <span class='it'>new</span>. The inhabitants, men, women and
children, truly seemed to us to have reflected in their
own natures the marvelous greenness and freshness
of the close surrounding forests; the village was poor,
like all new places, and not one quarter its present
size. Indeed, we call it a city now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you never can think what a house of refuge
it was to us poor people! I was glad from my heart
that there were none rich, none powerful here; that
all was one grand level, above which wisdom and
strength of mind, and superior goodness alone might
rise. I was glad, I say, for despise it as you may,
I am bold to acknowledge there was something
awfully repelling to me in the thought of looking <span class='it'>up</span>
to people because they happened to be rich, or occupy
by birth a high station. Even the notice taken of me
in my young days, in the place where I sojourned,
was galling to me. It savored too much of condescension,
which, child as I was, even then I despised
and hated. There were many children here
even in those days; for some years mine was the
only school—how well it was patronized I need not
say. I prospered, and was contented. Oh, it was
such a joy to look on our own comfortable home; to
know what a cheerful fire and plenty of food meant
in one’s own house! There is something so exhilarating
in the thought of independence and reliance on
one’s own exertions, that for a whole year after our
removal here I altogether abandoned my pencil and
my pen; I thought I would never labor with them
again. But I was mistaken in myself, as many
times before I had been. I knew not the wants and
necessities of my own nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The second winter I had continually a restless
yearning for higher and nobler pursuits than the mere
business of school-teaching; that supplied our natural
wants and necessities admirably, it is true, but there
were longings of my mind that it became as necessary
for me to supply. And so once more in the long
winter evenings I resumed my pencils and pen, and
I worked with them. It is impossible for me to express
to you the intense satisfaction following these
labors; it seemed as though I had found suddenly an
Aladdin’s lamp, and that it dispelled the darkness and
gloom of undefined yearning, and showed me a true
and a great end that I could accomplish! I did not
then immediately force my new productions upon
the editors, but remembering well that one salutary
lesson I received long ago, I strove hard to perfect
myself. It would be wearisome for you to listen to
the narration of my progress till I had gradually
mounted up into the notice of the noble people of the
west; how kindly and charitably they hailed my
writings; how encouraging were the letters which,
from many sources unexpected and unsought, I received,
I will leave you to imagine—I felt then as
though I were truly working out my destiny. Words
crowded to my lips for utterance; thoughts pleaded
in my brain to be heard; I longed to speak words of
encouragement and strength to others—such words
as from my own experience I knew full well many
an overburdened soul needed. I spoke them, and I
humbly hope they found acceptance and regard in
many a heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will ask if I then was wholly satisfied? You
will ask if notoriety pleased me? If I cared for no
other and humbler good after I had attained that—in
short, if I did not yearn for other love than that
lavished on me by my own kin. In all calmness and
confidence now, I can answer, yes! there were hopes
unsatisfied, desires unfulfilled. Admiration was not
<span class='it'>all</span> I craved—commendation not all I coveted. But
years passed on, and with them the time when I could
have rejoiced in loving and in being loved. The
wild dream that haunted my mind of a perfect happiness
on earth, of another kind of affection than I
had yet received or given, went by. Coldness, and
I am almost constrained to think at times, heartlessness,
have usurped the place once occupied by the
winged god; the altar which needed but a word to be
enkindled and wrapped in flame, is torn away—a
calm, immovable spirit occupies its place. I am
not lonely or unhappy, only I feel strangely changed.
I feel old in spirit; there may be no cloud, but there
certainly is no sunshine; passionless now, and without
the least craving for human love, my years glide
on. I am satisfied in having helped to make the happiness
of those for whom I have labored, and yet,
true to woman’s belief, I must say, I am well aware
that I have missed life’s highest good; I have passed
by, in my eager search for a something that has not
<span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span>
satisfied, that bright possession which the poorest of
earth’s children, equally with the most exalted have
extended to them by the hand of our <a id='ben'></a>beneficent Father.
Do you think I am strangely confiding with one whom
for ten years I have not known by thought, or word,
or deed? But we were children together; and I remember
how that you more than all I left behind me
knew the thoughts and desires of my inner life.
Doubtless, since we have come to be <span class='it'>women</span>, we
have both much changed, but at this hour I will believe
you sympathize with me as in the days of old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not long ago there came one to me, a man gifted
with noble intellectual faculties, and rich in heart-wealth;
he has wished me to be his wife; but knowing
as I do what a very pauper I am in all that is
best calculated to make his a happy home—you will
understand I am not speaking of fortune or beauty
<span class='it'>now</span>—I have declined his suit. I cannot regard him
as I could have a few, <span class='it'>but</span> a few short years ago. I
do not love him as my imagination tells me that
woman <span class='it'>can</span> and <span class='it'>should</span> love. For a moment when
I read his words, my heart beat wildly—I was happy;
but that passed quickly; I distrust myself; I do not
wish <span class='it'>now</span> that any one should intrust to me a charge
of their happiness through life; it would be madness,
and no less than foul wrong in me to wed with one
whose affection I could make but such a paltry return.
I give to you the answer I sent him; it is the sum
total of my thoughts on this subject—and I would
ask you as you read them, do you not think that
there is but little to envy in one who has flung away
a diamond, for a trifling but more brilliant gem?</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_11'>I.—HEIDELBERG IN SEPTEMBER.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was just setting on the last day of August,
when the ponderous <span class='it'>eilwagen</span>, in which I had journeyed
from Frankfort, rounded the foot of the Holy
Mountain into the Valley of the Neckar, and Heidelberg—the
brave, romantic, beautiful old electoral
city—was stretched out before me on the opposite
side of the river. Far above it rose the wooded
Kaiserstuhl, midway down whose side hung the
granite bastions, terraces and roofless halls of the
famed Castle. Heavy masses of ivy hung from its
arches, and overran the quaint sculpture of its walls,
while the foliage of its gardens was visible behind,
deep in the shadow of the mountain. A faint yellow
glow trembled over the pines and birches on the top
of the Kaiserstuhl, and kept the clear blue on the
distant hills up the Neckar. Down the steep paths
of the Holy Mountain, on my left, came the peasant-girls,
with baskets on their heads, laden with the
purple clusters of the Muscatel, and talking to each
other gayly over garden-walls, and under arbors,
which made a “green twilight” even at noon.
Careless students, pipe in hand, sauntered along the
river bank, listening to the sweet evening chimes,
rung first in the towers of the Hauptkirche, and
taken up like an echo, from village to village, among
the hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking forward to Heidelberg as a place for rest
and quiet study, there was something peculiarly
grateful and tranquilizing in the scene. To my eyes
the scenery presented a mingling of the wild with
the cultivated—of the pastoral with the grand—a
combination so inspiring that I found it difficult to
keep my enthusiasm within reasonable bounds.
From the river bank, above the bridge, cannon began
firing a closing salute for the Grand Duke’s
birth-day, and my heart never kept more bounding
time to the minute-guns on a Fourth of July at
home. The German passengers in the <span class='it'>eilwagen</span>
were highly gratified by my delight, for all Germans
are proud of Heidelberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By a piece of good fortune the friends who had
left me at Mayence and arrived the day before, happened
to be passing up the main street when the
vehicle stopped, and I was spared the risk of searching
for them, which, to one ignorant of the language,
was no slight task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a day or two, by the help of a <span class='it'>valet de place</span>, who
spoke half a dozen words of English, we obtained
rooms in a large house overhanging the Neckar.
From one side we looked upon the Heiligenberg, so
near that we could hear the girls singing among the
vines every morning, and all day long the rapid river
below us was noisy with raftsmen, guiding the pines
they had felled among the Suabian hills down to the
Rhine. On the other side the Kaiserstuhl stood between
us and the eastern sky, and we always saw
the sunrise first on the opposite mountains. In the
cool, cloudless autumn mornings, the air was full of
church-chimes and merry voices, which came echoed
back from the hills, so that our first waking sensation
was one of pleasure, and every day brought us some
new form of enjoyment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The valley of the Neckar is narrow, and only the
little slopes which here and there lie between the
feet of its wooded mountains are capable of cultivation.
Higher up, there are glens and meadows of
luxuriant grass, to which the peasants drive their
cattle, further still, it is barren and rocky, and upon
the summits dwells a solitude as complete as upon
the unsettled prairies of the far West. An hour’s
walk takes one from the busy streets of the little city
to this beautiful and lonely region, and the stranger
may explore the paths he finds leading far away
among the hills, for weeks together, without exhausting
their store of new scenes and influences. The
calm impressiveness of these mountain landscapes
disposes the mind to quiet thought, and one who has
felt them till their spirit grew familiar, is at no loss
to comprehend the inspiration from which Schiller,
Uhland and Hauff have sung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a favorite habit with the Heidelbergers, and
one into which the traveler willingly falls, to spend
the last hour or two of daylight in a walk by the
Neckar, in the gardens of the castle, or off in the
forests. At spots of especial beauty rustic inns have
been erected, where, at tables in the shade, the visiter
is furnished with beer, cool from its underground
vaults, and thick curds, to which a relish is given by
sugar and powdered cinnamon. The most noted of
these places is the Wolfsbrunnen, about a mile and
a half from the city, in a lonely glen, high up on the
mountain. A large stone basin, two centuries old,
stands there, pouring out a stream of the coldest and
purest water, dammed up below to form a small
pool, in which hundreds of trout breed and grow fat
from the benevolence of visiters. A wooden inn,
two stories high, with balconies on all sides, is
nestled among the trees, and farther down the stream
a little mill does its steady work from year to year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A party was once formed by our German friends,
and we spent a whole Saturday afternoon in this delicious
retreat. Frau Dr. S——, who was always
ready for any piece of social merriment, had the
management of the excursion, and directed us with
the skill of a general. Fräulein Marie, her niece, a
blooming maiden of eighteen, and Madame Louise ——,
a sprightly little widow from <a id='mann'></a>Mannheim, with
Dr. S——, one or two students, and we Americans,
were her subjects. Every thing was arranged with
precision before we started. The books, the cards,
the music (including a most patient guitar) were distributed
among those best able to carry them, and
we finally started, without any particular order of
march. German etiquette forbids a lady to take the
<span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span>
arm of a male friend, unless she is betrothed to him;
talking is allowed, fortunately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we climbed to the terraces of the castle, we
could see the thread of the Rhine, in the distance,
sparkling through the haze. The light air which
came down the Neckar was fragrant with pine and
the first falling leaves of summer trees. The vineyards
below us were beginning to look crisp and
brown, but hanging from stake to stake the vines
were bent down by blue clusters, with the bloom
still upon them. Troops of light-hearted students,
children, blue-eyed and blond-haired, and contented
citizens, were taking the same path, and like them,
we forgot every thing but the sense of present happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had a table spread upon the upper balcony of
the inn, after our scattered forces returned from
many a long ramble up the glen and out on the
meadows. Frau Dr. S—— ordered a repast, and the
“landlady’s daughter”—not the sweet maid of Uhland’s
song, but a stout-armed and stout-waisted
damsel—brought us a jar of curds, dripping with the
cool water in which it had stood. A loaf of brown
bread next made its appearance, followed by a stone
jug of foaming beer, and two or three dishes of those
prune-tarts peculiar to Germany, completed the fare.
On the porch below us, two or three musicians played
waltzes, and the tables around the fountain were
filled with students, laughing, clinking their beer-glasses,
or trolling some burschen chorus. Our own
table did not lack the heartiest spirit of mirth; this
could not be otherwise so long as Frau Dr. S——
sat at the head of it. The students were gay and full
of life, and even Dr. S——, the most earnest and
studious of the party, was so far influenced by the
spirit of the time, that he sang the “King of Thule”
with more warmth than I had thought possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The afternoon sped away like a thought, and
Heidelberg was forgotten until the faint sound of its
evening chimes came up the valley. We returned
in time to see a glowing sky fade over the mountains
of Alsatia, and then first, as the twilight gathered,
came the remembrance of home—a remembrance
which did not chide the happiness of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of these excursions was accompanied by a
different and less agreeable finale. A small party
had been arranged to visit the ruins of St. Michael’s
Chapel, on the summit of the Holy Mountain. I had
ascended it previously, after an hour’s climbing, directly
up the side, but as ladies were to accompany
us, it was necessary to take a winding road, two or
three miles in length, to reach the chapel. We
mounted, by flights of steps through the terraced
vineyards, to the Philosopher’s Walk, followed it to
a retired glen called the Angels’ Meadow, and then
entered a forest-road. The wind roared loudly
among the trees, and the sky grew darker as we
ascended, but we took little heed of these signs.
Finally, however, on reaching a rocky point whence
we could look down on the Rhine-plain, we were
somewhat alarmed to see a heavy rain-cloud approaching
from the west. The chapel was still half
a mile distant, and its open walls and dismantled
towers could afford us no protection, so there was
nothing left but to turn about and descend with all
speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rain had just crossed the Rhine, and would
probably be half an hour in reaching us, and as we
could trace its misty advance on the sheet of landscape
below us, we hoped to time our rate of walking
so as to reach some shelter before it struck the
mountain. Vain hope!—before we reached the
Angels’ Meadow the wind fairly howled among the
trees, and swept over us, laden with dust and
showers of leaves. The rain followed, and as our
path led over the exposed ridge of the mountain, the
arrows of the storm smote pitilessly in our faces.
The ladies shrieked, the men groaned, and, like Norval’s
barbarians, we “rushed like a torrent,”—and
with a torrent—“upon the vale.” When we arrived
at the village of Neuenheim the shower was nearly
over, but it might have continued all day, without
more effect upon us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The village of Ziegelhausen, up the Neckar, with
its grim old convent, gardens and cascades, and the
delightful arbors of vine, reaching down to the very
brink of the river, is another favorite place of resort.
The pastor of its church, who was familiar with our
German friends, would frequently join us in an afternoon
walk, followed by a cup of tea in the garden of
the inn, and frequently by a share in the games of
the village children. The pastor was a most jovial,
genial character; he sang very finely—indeed, he
was brother to the <span class='it'>primo tenore</span> in the Opera at
Brunswick—and his wit was inexhaustible. His religion
was as genuine as his cheerfulness; it was no
gloomy ascetism, which looked on mirth as sin, but
a joyous, affectionate and abounding spirit, bright as
God’s sunshine and as unconscious of its blessing.
How happily passed those September afternoons,
warmed by such true social feeling, and refreshed by
all the kindly influences of nature! If a return like
this to the simple joys of the child’s heart be but obtained
by the mature age of a nation, I could almost
wish this country might grow old speedily. The
restless energy of Youth is still upon us. The nation
overflows with active impulses, which fear nothing,
and yield to nothing. We have not yet felt the need
of Rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have said nothing of my struggles with the perverse
German language—my daily sieges, advancing
from trench to trench, till the strong fortress was
stormed and all its priceless stores in my possession.
I have not spoken of my blunders arising from ignorance
and inexperience, nor the novelty of customs
and life so different from ours. These would be
tedious, nor are they necessary to give some impression
of Heidelberg in its most delightful season. The
most romantic and picturesque of all German cities,
and therefore most thronged by romance-hunting
tourists, its good old social character is still happily
preserved. The last Revolution has fortunately
spared it, and in spite of railroads beside its mountains,
and steamboats on the Neckar, it will be for
many years to come one of the pleasantest spots in
Europe.</p>

<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;For when winter is past, and the snow</p>
<p class='line'>Has melted away from the earth like a dream,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;No flowers that in loveliness grow</p>
<p class='line'>More dear, or more beautiful ever can be</p>
<p class='line'>Than the simple grass of the field to me.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>It springs up so quick, when showers call aloud</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;For every thing glad to come forth;</p>
<p class='line'>And when the sun bursts from his rainbow-cloud,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;As the rain passes off to the north—</p>
<p class='line'>It shines in his glory, and laughs in his light,</p>
<p class='line'>The green grass of the field, so glistening and bright.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Happy children love in the grass to play,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Thick and soft for their dancing feet;</p>
<p class='line'>And there the wild bees gather honey all day</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;From the clover so blushing and sweet,</p>
<p class='line'>And find no stores that the garden can yield</p>
<p class='line'>Are richer than those from the grass of the field.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The lark makes his nest in the twining grass,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And methinks when he soars to the skies,</p>
<p class='line'>And sings the clear notes that all others surpass,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;His gladness must surely arise</p>
<p class='line'>From the lowly content of that innocent breast,</p>
<p class='line'>Which finds in the grass of the field a safe nest.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>There are few who notice the delicate flower</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;That blooms in the grass at their feet,</p>
<p class='line'>Yet the proudest plant in the greenhouse or bower</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Is not fairer, or more complete;</p>
<p class='line'>And to those who observe—it is clearly revealed</p>
<p class='line'>That God clothes with beauty the grass of the field.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The mower comes out so busy and blythe,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;At the dawn of a summer’s day,</p>
<p class='line'>And the tall waving grass at the stroke of his scythe</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Is cut down and withers away:</p>
<p class='line'>But the fragrance it sends over valley and hill</p>
<p class='line'>Makes the grass of the field loved and lovely still.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And while on the perishing grass we look,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;A soft voice in the summer wind</p>
<p class='line'>Will whisper the words of the Holy Book</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;To the humble and thoughtful mind.</p>
<p class='line'>“All flesh is as grass,” it will seem to say—</p>
<p class='line'>“Like the flower of the grass ye shall pass away.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>But oh! we will hope with a faith secure—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Through the years of this mortal strife—</p>
<p class='line'>On the words of the Lord, which forever endure,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;For in them is eternal life:</p>
<p class='line'>Thus lessons of truth all our pleasures will yield,</p>
<p class='line'>And wisdom we’ll learn from the grass of the field.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MISS AUGUSTA C. TWIGGS.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>This seems a little word, while we repeat it less
than one second of time is consumed, yet in its signification
it is a great word—a word of vast and unmeasured
import:</p>

<p class='pindent'>By it we understand a just appreciation of the
good, the beautiful, the pleasant, the worthy and the
useful:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still it is not alike to all: Tastes differ with characters,
and characters with men. By an all wise
Creator was this so ordained, and in every thing we
see the wisdom and the beauty of His system.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suppose, for instance, we pass in fancy around
this vast globe, as we progress onward, countries,
climates, men and characters undergo every conceivable
grade of change. Gradually we pass from
regions inhabited by enlightened men—men of learning
and deep research, men to whom Science seems
to have lent her very self, until we come to a race
of beings between whom and the brute creation
there is scarcely a demarcation: Yet each and every
one of these thousands upon thousands of countless
beings has his own peculiar sphere of action, and his
own especial tastes, adapted to his position and circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taste may, however, be improved or debased,
elevated to the highest appreciations, the noblest conceptions,
or lowered to the most sordid views, the
most groveling level, and this is left to man himself—to
rise or fall, to sink or soar, is left to his own
choice, and is within his own power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course this remark is not unqualified, it is not
intended that the natives of Central Africa, or of the
inhabited regions around the Poles, can improve
their moral condition, and rise to the same high
standard as may the enlightened nations of Europe
or of our own loved country. To assert such a
thing would be preposterous, to expect it ridiculous.
Our resources are not their resources, our advantages
not theirs, but there is implanted in the breast of
every man a frame-work and basis, with which, and
upon which, he may build something that shall make
him better than he now is. And the greater his advantages,
the vaster the amount of material furnished
him wherewith to work, the more will be expected
of him, and higher and higher will the eyes of men
rise, seeking for the pinnacles of that temple of the
mind which they of a right expect him to rear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To ensure without fail the meeting of their views,
(perchance to surpass them,) it is not sufficient to
seize indiscriminately and pile block upon block,
and stone upon stone. It is not sufficient to heap up
a vast mountain of brick and mortar, jumbled together
without taste or elegance, and then write upon
it—This is Parian marble—these are classic proportions.
This will not do, the cheat will be found out,
and Ridicule will mingle her laughter with the shouts
and jeers of the multitude as they mock and scan the
shallow attempt at imposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What then is to be done?</p>

<p class='pindent'>This—let us seek Taste, let us acquaint ourselves
with her, coax her, court her, make her our own,
and we are safe. But we must be sure it is no impostor,
no false being who assumes the name, for
there are such, and they are to be shunned. We
must “be sure we are right, then” onward, right
onward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>True taste will teach us to select the choice blocks,
the finely grained and unflawed marble, she will bid
us to reject the huge, coarse, glittering rocks with
which some will strive to dazzle our eyes and mislead
our judgment, and cause us to turn aside from
those brittle and perishing kinds which will scarce
bear handling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having chosen our materials, now let us build.
Up go the blocks one after another, and high the
temple grows. Day by day it increases in height,
but why is it men stand and gaze with mortified and
disappointed looks upon the structure? Why do no
sounds of encouragement, no acclamations and
shouts of admiration reach the ear? Hear the reason—we
sought Taste—we courted her, we bid her
aid us seek our materials, and teach us how to judge
of them. She did so—that done we scorned her aid,
we forgot her, and trusting in ourselves we reared a
vast work of folly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But “<span class='it'>nil desperandum</span>,” there is yet time. Tear
down the monument of heedlessness and call Taste
to teach us once again. Faithful she returns at our
bidding. Now hark to the sound of the mallet and
chisel as they ring against the stone, chip by chip
of superfluous material is worked away, piece by
piece which is unneeded is broken off and thrown
aside until some other work shall call them into
use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now seems to become exhumed, as from a grave
of stone and rubbish, the massive pedestal, the firm
base, the graceful column, the sculptured capital and
the rich cornice. Day by day, and hour by hour,
these multiply in true and classic beauty, and higher
and higher skyward soars the now elegant structure,
until, amid the shouts and admiration of the world,
the voice of Reason proclaims that Taste has
fashioned it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, then, is an edifice, a work worthy of the
mind, formed from materials the choicest within
man’s reach, wrought out and builded by the hand of
Taste; it is worthy to be gazed upon, to be admired
and copied by all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Age after age will go by, but still it will stand firm,
and beautiful, and admired as when the artist gave
<span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span>
the last stroke, and proclaimed it to the world as
finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Are proofs required, among the names of the ancients
may be found those time-honored and long
worshiped ones of Lysippus, Polycletus, Praxiteles,
Timanthes, Appelles, Zeuxis, Parrhasius, Plato,
Aristotle, Pliny, Ovid, Pollio, Catullus, Demosthenes,
Thucydides, Xenophon, Aristophanes, Orpheus,
Archilocus and Timotheus, together with
many, many of their cotemporaries, for whose
names I have no space, but whose memories are
still, and still are to be, revered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following in the path which these have hewn
through the thickets of prejudice and ignorance
comes a long bright train. Amidst the stars of this
latter day firmament gleam conspicuous the names
of Banks, Young, Cole, West, White, Vandyck,
Tasso, Titian, Rittenhouse, Mozart, Milton, Crabbe,
Gallileo and Godfry, and ever and anon new and
brilliant planets flash forth and shed their glad effulgence
around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could this be without Taste?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It could not. Glorious and rich and varied as are
the works of those whose efforts and the productions
of whose minds have tended to elevate and improve
our condition, they never could have been without
Taste to suggest—Taste to aid, and Taste to accomplish
the mighty, the stupendous, the gigantic works
they have wrought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was it, let us inquire, that induced the
ancient Egyptians to build the city of Thebes in
such glorious magnificence that even its ruins produced
effects upon historians to cause them to be
immortalized? Homer tells of her hundred gates,
from each of which two hundred chariots and ten
thousand warriors could issue at a time. To her
palaces painting and sculpture had lent all their art,
combining to render this city one of the glories of the
world. Was not this Taste?</p>

<p class='pindent'>What, too, induced them to erect those monuments
of the strength of man and tyranny of kings—the
Obelisks and Pyramids, to erect them in such huge
size and vast strength that still they stand, as through
long ages they have stood, firm and immovable as
the “everlasting hills?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Need we ask Astronomy, that grand and elevating
science, the contemplation of which forces upon us
our own insignificance, and raises us from “Nature
up to Nature’s God”—that science which teaches us
to admire and wonder, to gaze and fear, to glorify
and adore the <span class='it'>Great Being</span> who formed “Arcturus,
Orion and the Pleiades.” Need we ask to what considerations
upon the part of man we are indebted for
the important and immense researches which all
lie open to us, which teach us to trace out the constellations,
and “call the stars by their names”—which
drew Phytheas from his home and caused
him to wander unsatisfied with the observations he
was able to make in his own country, from the Pillars
of Hercules to the mouth of the Tanais—which
made Egypt, Rome, Spain, France, Germany and
Denmark the cradles of the then infant science?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is it necessary to reply it is Taste?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turn we then to Philosophy, and in the deep researches
of Thales, the moral reasoning of Socrates,
the eloquence of Plato, and the disinterestedness of
Zenocrates read of Taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chemistry, with all its brilliant discoveries, and
Rhetoric, in its elegance, speak of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Music, Oratory, History, Geography, Grammar
and Physic are each and all of them proofs of Taste
in its truth and purity; and Poetry shouts forth with
glad and eager pride Eureka! we have found it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beauty, delicacy and usefulness of Botany,
the rich and varied hue of the flowers, those “gems
of earth,” whisper softly to us of Taste; and the
importance of Anatomy proves it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Metaphysics and Geometry demonstrate its truth;
while the wild bird’s carol hymns forth its notes of
praise and gladness to the Creator of it and of that
element of man’s happiness, Taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is here, it is there, it is everywhere, one grand,
pervading principle, one first element, one chief ingredient
of all things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was implanted in the mind by <span class='it'>Him</span> who formed
us, and it is as much the duty of man to cultivate and
improve his taste, as it is his duty to improve and
cultivate any other talent lent him to keep; and he
will be considered no more excusable for wrapping
this precious deposit in a napkin and hiding it away
than was the servant of old, who buried the talent
until the coming of his lord. Let us then cultivate
Taste, each according to the kind and portion
given us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has been said that “every man is born to excel
in something, and the only reason so many fail is
they mistake their calling.” Be this as it may, it
sounds marvelously like sense, and it would be well
for every one to examine strictly, that he may discover
wherein it is intended he shall excel, and what
the peculiar Taste or Tastes may be which, to himself,
to society at large, and to a <span class='it'>higher power</span> than
either, it is his duty to cultivate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet although Taste has been given us, and we are
required to improve and use it to the best advantage,
it is not intended there are no other gifts bestowed
on man which can equal it. That would be to
assume for it more than could well be proven. It is
intended that Taste shall act as a means of enjoyment
and happiness, as a means whereby we can investigate
causes, and admire and apply effects—a
means whereby we can dive into the very depths of
science and open the sealed treasure-house of knowledge—a
means of searching out the beauties and
glories of creation, and comprehending, as far as the
mind of man is capable of comprehending, the wonderful
omnipotence of the Deity.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY T. S. ARTHUR.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>At nineteen, Silas Loring left college and went
into a store to be educated for a merchant. At the
same time, a school-companion, named Alfred Benedict,
with whom he had been intimate, was placed
by his parents in the counting-room of a large shipper.
The two young men had enjoyed equal advantages,
so far as education was concerned; but they had improved
these advantages differently. The father of
Loring early impressed upon his mind the idea that
wealth gave a man all power and influence in the
world; that it was the greatest good that could be
sought; while the father of Benedict urged his son
to gain knowledge as the highest and best possession.
The two young men had been influenced, as well by
their natural tastes and feelings as by the opinions
and advice of their parents. On leaving college,
Loring left behind him all affection for literature or
scientific pursuits, and took with him only an ardent
desire to become wealthy, accompanied by a confident
assurance that he possessed the ability required
to attain the summit of his wishes. Benedict, on the
contrary, entered the world with his love of knowledge
as active as ever, and his desire for its attainment
more ardent than when he passed at first over
the threshold of Wisdom’s temple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Equal as to external advantages, the two young
men started in the world. Neither of their parents
were rich, though both were able to give their children
a good education, that surest guaranty of success.
But difference of purpose in a few years made
a great difference in their relative positions. When
Loring was twenty-five years of age he was a partner
in the house where he had served his apprenticeship,
and the most active and really intelligent business
man in the firm; while Benedict was merely a book-keeper,
receiving a salary of twelve hundred dollars
a year. All the energies of the active mind of Loring,
inspired by his love of money, were given to business;
while the no less active mind of Benedict was
as deeply absorbed in literary pursuits and scientific
investigations. As a book-keeper, the latter was
faithful, attentive and accurate, and valued by his
employers; but beyond his journal and ledger his
thoughts never penetrated the arcana of trade. He
had no affection for it. His mind loved rather to
explore the arcana of knowledge, and gather in from
fields that were ever opening before him, rich harvests
of intelligence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the manners and appearance of the two young
men there was also a noticeable change. Loring had
an air of self-importance, and an off-hand, dashing
sort of manner, that bespoke a mind well satisfied
with itself, and conscious of having done something.
But Benedict had become more quiet and unobtrusive.
He looked like a man who did not entertain a very
high opinion of himself, as being of consequence in
the community.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As men appear in society, so are they usually
estimated by the mass. Loring was bowed to across
the street a dozen times in every square; was met in
company by a hearty shake of the hand, and treated
wherever he went as an individual of some importance.
And such he really felt himself to be. Benedict,
on the contrary, might walk a dozen squares
without receiving a nod, or mingle in society and be
almost unnoticed and alone. But he did not feel this.
In fact he was hardly conscious of it; for he rarely,
if ever, thought any thing about the estimation in
which others held him. His mind was in a higher
and purer region.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The intimate friendship that had existed between
Loring and Benedict, did not continue very long
after they left college, although they remained friends
and acquaintances, and were interested in each other
for some years. But, after Loring had changed from
a clerk to a merchant, he began to feel that he was
no longer on a level with a mere book-keeper, who
was likely to remain a book-keeper for life. Merchants
were now his associates. Men who used to
bow to him with distant formality, <span class='it'>now</span> took him cordially
by the hand, and were as familiar with him as
he had been with mere clerks before. He likewise
received invitations to the houses of these merchants,
and was introduced into a new and higher circle.
In this circle he never met his old friend Benedict.
Is it any wonder that he looked down upon him as
an inferior? None. We see by means of the atmosphere
by which we are surrounded, whether naturally
or spiritually. The atmosphere in which the
mind of Loring breathed and saw, was so different
from the one that gave life and vision to the mind of
Benedict, that he was unable to see by it the true
quality and character of his friend. He could see in
his own atmosphere, but that which surrounded the
humble book-keeper was darkness to his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the years went by, Loring accumulating gold,
and Benedict treasures of knowledge, that neither
moth nor rust could corrupt, nor thieves break through
and steal. As these treasures increased, he began to
feel a desire to impart something of what he possessed
to others. This desire prompted him to write
out his reflections, experiences, and the new views
that were constantly pressing in upon his mind, and
send them to the various literary and scientific journals
for publication. It was not long before this brought
him into honorable notice, and made his name familiar
to men of intelligence throughout the country, with
many of whom he gradually came into correspondence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has become of Benedict?” asked Mr.
<span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span>
Loring, one day of the merchant whose book-keeper
he had been for many years. “I have missed him
from your store for some time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He left me several months ago,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How came that? But I suppose his mind got so
lost in his literary pursuits that he was no longer
good for any thing as a clerk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was faithful and correct to the last,” promptly
answered the individual to whom this remark was
made. “I never had and never expect to have a
more valuable clerk than Benedict. But he has obtained
a better place, and one more suited to his
tastes and abilities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, where has he gone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Bowdoin College. The Professorship of —— was
offered to him, and he accepted it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know that he had any friends away off
there. Isn’t it rather singular that he should be appointed
to such a chair? Do you think him capable
of filling it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I presume those who appointed him knew his
ability.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he apply for it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. He knew nothing of the vacancy until he
was notified of his appointment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a little singular,” remarked Loring, wondering
for the moment how a man of so little importance,
and no very distinguished ability, should
be voluntarily tendered a high professorship in
Bowdoin College. But the wonder did not occupy
his mind very long. It passed away with the thought
of his old school-friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great activity and energy in a business already
firmly established, in which was ample capital, made
Loring the possessor, in a few years, of quite a handsome
property. Ambitious of a more rapid increase
of fortune, and believing that he ought to have the
entire benefit of his activity, energy, and capacity
for trade, he withdrew from the house in which he
was a partner, and commenced business alone. He
did not err in his calculations. The results was as
favorable as he had expected. Money came in more
rapidly, and with its accumulation rose his ideas of
his own importance, until he looked down upon
every man whose coffers were not quite as full as
his own, at the same time that he felt himself to be
as good as any millionaire in the land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a little singular how the mere possession of
money raises a man’s ideas of his own importance,
and causes him to think meanly of all who are not
favored with any considerable portion of this world’s
goods. Upon what a slender basis of real worth do
men sometimes build a towering structure of self-conceit!
Wealth is very rarely the correspondent
of solid virtue and sterling merit in those who
possess it; not that men of wealth are less virtuous
or meritorious as a class, but wealth, upon which
most persons value themselves, is not the true
standard for estimating the man. It never gives
quality to the heart, principles to the mind, nor to the
understanding rational intelligence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Mr. Loring continued to grow richer, his ideas
of his own importance continued to rise, until he felt
himself quite an “exclusive” in society. At the age
of forty, he determined to take a trip across the
Atlantic, and see the world abroad. He must spend
some time in London, Paris and Italy. In order to
be prepared for this journey, he brushed up his French,
and spent his leisure time in reading about the places
he proposed to visit. So far as his knowledge of
matters and things in his own country, out of the
mercantile sphere, was concerned, it was very
limited. Even in politics he was not very well
posted up. As to what was doing in literature and
science, he was altogether ignorant. He was a
successful merchant, and that was about all that could
be said of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All things ready, Mr. Loring took passage in a
steamer for Liverpool. The ship had cast off her
moorings, and was gliding swiftly along the smooth
waters of the bay, when the merchant, in turning
his eyes from the diminishing city to the nearer and
more palpable objects on board the vessel that was
bearing him on to the ocean, noticed a familiar face.
At first he was at a loss where to place its owner.
But soon his memory was clear upon that subject.
His old friend, Benedict, was a fellow-passenger!
The eyes of the latter were upon him, and his countenance
about expressing a pleasurable recognition,
when Loring turned away and glanced back again
upon the dim and distant city. He did not wish to
renew the acquaintance. When he next looked
around upon his companions for the voyage, Benedict
was not to be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were one hundred passengers on board, and
among them several men of high reputation in the
United States. A former Governor of Massachusetts,
whose name and fame were familiar to every one,
was among the number; also two men from the
South, who had distinguished themselves during
many years in the national legislature. One of them
had held the office of Secretary of State. Besides
these, there were many men of standing and character
both from the mercantile class and the learned professions.
In looking over the list of passengers,
Mr. Loring was well satisfied to find himself in such
good company. The only drawback was the presence
of so obscure an individual as Mr. Benedict,
with whom he had once been acquainted, but toward
whom he must now, in justice to his own
character and position, conduct himself as a stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were the reflections of Mr. Loring, as he
turned from the vessel’s side and went below, late
in the afternoon of the day on which they had sailed.
On entering the cabin, the first objects that met his
eyes were the ex-governor of Massachusetts and
Mr. Benedict engaged in conversation. This surprised
him at first, but on reflection, he explained the
circumstance by supposing that Benedict had intruded
himself upon the individual with whom he was conversing,
and that the latter submitted to the intrusion
from mere politeness. He sat down at some distance
from them, expecting to see their interview
quickly terminated. But he was disappointed in
this, for the parties grew more and more interested.
Whenever Benedict spoke, he observed that the
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span>
other listened with deep attention, and that his
manner toward him was always respectful, and sometimes
even deferential. The conversation was prolonged
until tea-time, and then the two men separated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something in this that the man of
wealth could not understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the next day Mr. Loring sought an opportunity
to make the formal acquaintance of Mr. ——, from
the Bay State, through the introduction of a friend
on board, who presented him as “one of our first
merchants,” going out to visit Europe. Mr. —— was
very polite, and made some commonplace remarks
to the merchant, who replied with a self-importance
in his manner that did not make the impression
he designed. The ex-governor knew just
how much money was worth as a standard by which
to estimate the man. The words, “one of our first
merchants,” made no impression upon him whatever.
In fact, he scarcely noticed it. After talking
a short time with Mr. Loring, with a polite bow he
moved away and joined Mr. Benedict, who was
standing on the opposite side of the vessel. He was
soon again in close conversation with this obscure
individual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Loring was not only surprised at this, but chafed.
It puzzled as well as annoyed him. He could not
but remark that Mr. Benedict was perfectly at his
ease with the distinguished individual who had just
left him, and that there was nothing in the manner of
Mr. —— approaching to condescension. Not many
minutes elapsed before they were joined by a third
person, to whom Mr. —— presented Loring’s old
friend in a formal introduction. This individual was
from the South. He had formerly held the office of
Secretary of State at Washington. At the mention
of Mr. Benedict’s name he shook him warmly by the
hand, and treated him with marked attention. The
three men then went below, where Loring saw them,
about an hour afterward, in the centre of a group of
five or six, all men of standing and character in the
United States. Benedict was speaking, and all were
listening to him with deep attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can it be possible that his fortunes have changed—that
he has become wealthy?” the merchant said to
himself; and a feeling of respect for his old acquaintance
arose in his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day after day went by, and still Mr. Benedict continued
to be on terms of intimacy with these men,
while they treated Mr. Loring, who was introduced
to them by a friend, with reserved and distant politeness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is that man?” asked the merchant, affecting
not to know Benedict. The question was put to a
fellow-passenger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s Professor Benedict,” replied the person
addressed, manifesting surprise at the question.
“Are you not acquainted with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Loring shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have heard of him, of course?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t say that I have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not heard of Professor Benedict!” The passenger
looked into the face of Loring with a broad
stare. “Why he is known from one end of our
country to the other as a distinguished scholar and
man of science. His articles in the Quarterly Review,
and his essays on Political and Social Economy,
‘Wealth and Labor,’ ‘The Times,’ etc., have
won for him an enviable reputation. There are few
abler men in our country than Professor Benedict.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Loring asked no further questions. He felt
rebuked and mortified. Rich as he was, and highly
as he valued himself, he felt that the man of intellect
was ranked higher than the man of money. In
the small compass of that steam-vessel were clustered
together men of wealth, eminence, and political
distinction. There were few on board whom even
Mr. Loring would think beneath him; and yet he was
treated by them with no particular deference. When
he spoke, he was listened to with the politeness that
always accompanies good-breeding; but that was all.
None gathered around him; none sought his company;
none treated him as a man distinguished from
the rest. Wealth! that was a common possession;
but strong intellect was the god-like gift of the few;
and men bowed before it and yielded freely their
homage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proud man was deeply humbled during the
brief period occupied in sweeping across the broad
Atlantic, and he felt relieved and breathed more
freely the moment he set his foot on shore at Liverpool.
Shame had kept him from renewing his acquaintance
with Benedict, who continued to be an
object of interest to almost every one during the
voyage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the great world of London, Mr. Loring quickly
recovered his balance of mind. He took letters of
introduction to eminent merchants and bankers there,
by whom he was received and treated with the
greatest attention. He was again conscious of the
fact, that wealth was power, and that the possessor
of wealth ranked highest of any.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Paris he did not feel quite so much at ease.
He brought letters to the American Minister, the
Hon. Mr. ——, who had represented our country at
the palace of St. Cloud for some five years with
honor to himself and the nation; and was received
with the courtesy and attention which always marked
that gentleman’s conduct toward his countrymen.
Mr. Loring had only been in Paris a couple of days
when the American Minister said to him,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A distinguished countryman of ours is now
in Paris. He is to dine with me day after tomorrow,
in company with about fifty of the most
celebrated scientific and literary men in the city.
Your arrival is quite opportune, Mr. Loring, I shall,
of course, have the pleasure of your company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Loring bowed in acquiescence, and then inquired
who the distinguished American was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Professor Benedict,” replied the minister. “He
is an honor to our country, and I feel proud of the
opportunity I shall have of presenting him to men of
a like spirit with himself, to whom his name has
long been familiar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Loring was confounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has been for some years a member of the
Philosophical Society here,” continued the minister,
<span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span>
“and his communications, published in their annual
report of proceedings, are among the finest papers
that emanate from that body. They cause honorable
notice of our countryman to be made in all the
scientific journals of Europe. I need not ask you in
what estimation he is held at home, as I see by
Silliman’s Journal, the North American Review, and
the transactions of the various learned societies there,
that his worth is fully known and appreciated.
Have you ever had the pleasure of meeting him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” was the reply. “He is an old college-mate
of mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. We were quite intimate as young men; but
our pursuits in life were so different that, in the very
nature of things, this intimate acquaintance could not
continue. But I had the pleasure of meeting him
again in crossing the Atlantic. We came over in
the same steamer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you? That must have been a very pleasant
voyage. Fair weather the whole time, and the company
of so many men eminent for their talents. Mr.
Benedict says that the two weeks he spent upon the
ocean he shall number as the most agreeable of his
whole life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Loring now felt himself to be in a very awkward
position indeed. How to act he did not know.
He had accepted the American Minister’s invitation
to dine with him, and at his table he would meet the
man whom he had for years considered beneath him,
and whose very acquaintance he had dropped as
discreditable to one in his position. And this man
was to be the honored guest! Mr. Loring retired to
his hotel with his mind bewildered and his feelings
at a lower range in the thermometer of his self-esteem
than they had been for a very long time. If it
had not happened that Benedict came over in the same
steamer with him, and that he had cut his acquaintance
before he knew that he had become an individual
of some note, the way would have been plain
enough before him. He could have gone to the
dinner and renewed his old friendship, and felt
honored in being his countryman. But this he felt
to be out of the question now. Benedict might refuse
to know him, or might treat him in such a
manner as to wound and mortify him severely, and
expose him to the just contempt of men whose good
opinion he was the very man to value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The exceeding smallness of the foundation upon
which he had built a towering structure of self-importance,
was brought, by the circumstances in
which he was placed, with painful clearness to his
mind. He saw and felt, almost for the first time in
his life, that money was not every thing, and that
it would not make a man worshiped every where,
and by all classes of men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a long time the mind of Mr. Loring was in
debate as to the best course to be pursued. At one
time he resolved to send a note to the American
Minister, on the day the dinner was to take place,
regretting his inability to make one of his guests, on
account of indisposition. But this intention was
after a while abandoned, and he determined to leave
Paris for Italy on the next day. Like the first resolution,
this was also given up, and his mind was all
in confusion again. At length he decided, though
with much reluctance, that he would call upon Mr.
Benedict, and formally renew his acquaintance.
There was something, he felt, humiliating in this;
but it was a step greatly to be preferred to any that
he had yet thought of taking. He did not wish to
lie direct to the American Minister, by saying that
he was indisposed; nor did he wish to leave Paris
for at least a month.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By little and by little, since the day the steamer
left New York, the man of money had felt increasing
respect for the man of mind. He saw that he was
honored by those who were themselves honorable;
that he was known and highly esteemed by distinguished
men in Paris and throughout Europe,
while his name had scarcely been heard of beyond
his own city. There was no mistake about this. It
was all plain as daylight. The humble book-keeper
was a greater man than the purse-proud merchant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The severest conflict between pride and necessity
that ever took place in Mr. Loring’s mind, was that
which ended in a determination to call upon Mr.
Benedict. What his reception would be he knew
not, nor could he fix upon any mode of address, on
meeting him, that was satisfactory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, after hours of hesitation and debate, and
a re-consideration of the whole matter, the merchant
left his hotel and proceeded to that of the old
friend whom he had cast off years before as beneath
him in social rank and real worth. Gradually his
respect for him had been rising, until now he rather
looked up than down upon him, as the possessor of
something far more intrinsically excellent than any
thing of which he could boast. Known throughout
all Europe! The honored guest of the American
Minister! Courted by men of learning and distinction
in Paris! His very name a passport into the
first circles, and an introduction to the most eminent
men of the day! What had he been thinking about?
Where were his eyes, that he had not before seen
this rising star, now suddenly revealed to him, shining
in beauty and splendor? Respect was easily changed
into a feeling of deference. As distinctly as he could,
Mr. Loring endeavored to recall to his mind the appearance
and manner of Mr. Benedict, during the
voyage across the Atlantic. This he could not do
very distinctly, as he had kept out of his way as
much as possible. Still he could recollect that there
was ease, self-possession, dignity of manner, and the
consciousness of power. These were the visible
marks of a great man about him—not so much perceived
at the time at recognized, now that they
were remembered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the state of mind, and such were the
thoughts that oppressed Mr. Loring, as he started
on his humiliating errand. He, of course, expected
to be received with coldness and dignity, if received
at all. It might be that Mr. Benedict would decline
renewing the acquaintance that he had almost rudely
dropped, which, under the circumstances, would be
mortifying in the extreme, and compel him to decline
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>
the invitation to dine with the American
Minister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His card sent up, the merchant awaited the return
of the porter with serious misgivings at heart.
When that functionary returned, and signified that
Mr. Benedict would be happy to receive him, he
proceeded toward his apartments in a state of mind
such as he had never before experienced, and certainly
never wished to experience again. A door
was thrown open by the porter, and a man, in the
prime of life, stood near the centre of the room.
His quiet, thoughtful face, and calm, steady eye, so
well remembered, and so little changed by time, was
lit up instantly by a warm, frank smile, so natural
and familiar, that it seemed the smile of years before,
when they met as intimate friends. He stepped forward
quickly, and grasped Mr. Loring’s extended
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The merchant was subdued and humbled. He
could hardly utter the words that rose to his tongue.
He stood in the presence of one who was superior to
himself, and who yet assumed no consequence.
The beauty and true nobility of this he clearly saw,
because it affected himself. He felt that Benedict
possessed a generous, manly spirit and a true heart,
of the real worth of which he had never before had
any conception.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the interview that followed this meeting, no
allusion was made to the voyage across the Atlantic
by either party. The conversation mostly referred
to former years and events.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they separated, Mr. Loring was in some
doubt as to the real greatness of his old friend. He
saw nothing in him that he had not seen before. Not
a brilliant sentence was uttered; nothing out of the
common order was apparent in his conversation.
He even permitted the query to arise in his mind
whether or no he had not been overrated? Whether
distance had not lent enchantment to the view? This
was his state of mind when he met him again at the
American Minister’s, surrounded by some of the
most celebrated men of learning in Paris; but it
changed after Benedict had been toasted, and he replied
in an address of great beauty, force, and originality,
that enchained the attention of every one.
Loring was lost in astonishment and admiration;
nor was he less surprised at the apparent unconsciousness
of being more than an ordinary man manifested
by his every act and word during the five
hours that he observed him in the midst of these
eminent men, with the best of whom he could not
but acknowledge him, from what he then saw, to be
equal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man of money did not again come in contact
with the man of mind during his tour in Europe; nor
has he met him since his return home. But now,
and he cannot but wonder why it was not so before,
he hears the name of Professor Benedict frequently
mentioned, and often meets with it in the public
journals. Whenever he does so, the feeling of purse-proud
superiority that has grown with his growth, and
strengthened with his strength, has a leaf withered,
a flower blighted, or a branch riven from the stem.
But the roots of that feeling are vigorous, and strike
deeply into a rich soil. Although its very luxuriant
growth is at times checked, yet we cannot hope to
see the plant destroyed. It is too well matured, and
its aliment too abundant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cottle’s “Reminiscences of Coleridge” is just
such a book as damns its perpetrator forever in the
opinion of every gentleman who reads it. More and
more every day do we moderns <span class='it'>pavoneggiarsi</span> about
our Christianity; yet, so far as the <span class='it'>spirit</span> of Christianity
is concerned, we are immeasurably behind
the ancients. Mottoes and proverbs are the indices
of national character; and the Anglo-Saxons are
disgraced in having no proverbial equivalent to the
“<span class='it'>De mortuis nil nisi bonum.</span>” Moreover—where,

cannot help thinking, however, that the sentiment, if
not the idea intended, is more forcibly conveyed in
an <a id='apop'></a>apophthegm by one of the old English moralists,
James Puckle. By an ingenious figure of speech he

<p class='pindent'>That poets (using the word comprehensively, as
including artists in general) are a <span class='it'>genus irritabile</span>, is
well understood; but the <span class='it'>why</span>, seems not to be commonly
seen. An artist is an artist only by dint of his
exquisite sense of Beauty—a sense affording him
rapturous enjoyment, but at the same time implying,
or involving, an equally exquisite sense of Deformity
of disproportion. Thus a wrong—an injustice—done
a poet who is really a poet, excites him to a degree
which, to ordinary apprehension, appears disproportionate
with the wrong. Poets <span class='it'>see</span> injustice—<span class='it'>never</span>
where it does not exist—but very often where the
unpoetical see no injustice whatever. Thus the
poetical irritability has no reference to “temper” in
the vulgar sense, but merely to a more than usual clear-sightedness
in respect to Wrong:—this clear-sightedness
being nothing more than a corollary from the
vivid perception of Right—of justice—of proportion—in
a word, of το καλου. But one thing is clear—that
the man who is <span class='it'>not</span> “irritable,” (to the ordinary
apprehension,) is <span class='it'>no poet</span>.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>23.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let a man succeed ever so evidently—ever so
demonstrably—in many different displays of <span class='it'>genius</span>,
the envy of criticism will agree with the popular
voice in denying him more than <span class='it'>talent</span> in any. Thus
a poet who has achieved a great (by which I mean
an effective) poem, should be cautious not to distinguish
himself in any other walk of Letters. In
especial—let him make no effort in Science—unless
anonymously, or with the view of waiting patiently
the judgment of posterity. Because universal or
even versatile geniuses have rarely or never been
known, <span class='it'>therefore</span>, thinks the world, none such can
ever be. A “therefore” of this kind is, with the
world, conclusive. But what is the <span class='it'>fact</span>, as taught
us by analysis of mental power? Simply, that the
<span class='it'>highest</span> genius—that the genius which all men instantaneously
acknowledge as such—which acts
upon individuals, as well as upon the mass, by a
species of magnetism incomprehensible but irresistible
and <span class='it'>never resisted</span>—that this genius which
demonstrates itself in the simplest gesture—or even
by the absence of all—this genius which speaks
without a voice and flashes from the unopened eye—is
but the result of generally large mental power
existing in a state of <span class='it'>absolute proportion</span>—so that no
one faculty has undue predominance. <span class='it'>That</span> factitious
“genius”—that “genius” in the popular sense—which
is but the manifestation of the abnormal
predominance of some one faculty over all the others—and,
of course, at the expense and to the detriment,
of all the others—is a result of mental disease or
rather, of organic malformation of mind:—it is this
and nothing more. Not only will such “genius”
fail, if turned aside from the path indicated by its
predominant faculty; but, even when pursuing this
path—when producing those works in which, certainly,
it is <span class='it'>best</span> calculated to succeed—will give unmistakeable
indications of <span class='it'>unsoundness</span>, in respect
to general intellect. Hence, indeed, arises the just
idea that</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“Great wit to madness nearly is allied.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I say “<span class='it'>just</span> idea;” for by “great wit,” in this case,
the poet intends precisely the pseudo-genius to which
I refer. The true genius, on the other hand, is
necessarily, if not universal in its manifestations, at
least capable of universality; and if, attempting all
things, it succeeds in one rather better than in another,
this is merely on account of a certain bias by
which <span class='it'>Taste</span> leads it with more earnestness in the
one direction than in the other. With equal zeal, it
would succeed equally in all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To sum up our results in respect to this very
simple, but much <span class='it'>vexata questio</span>:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>What the world calls “genius” is the state of
mental disease arising from the undue predominance
of some one of the faculties. The works of such
genius are never sound in themselves and, in especial,
always betray the general mental insanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>
The <span class='it'>proportion</span> of the mental faculties, in a case
where the general mental power is <span class='it'>not</span> inordinate,
gives that result which we distinguish as <span class='it'>talent</span>:—and
the talent is greater or less, first, as the general
mental power is greater or less; and, secondly, as
the proportion of the faculties is more or less absolute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proportion of the faculties, in a case where
the mental power is inordinately great, gives that
result which <span class='it'>is</span> the true <span class='it'>genius</span> (but which, on account
of the proportion and seeming simplicity of its works,
is seldom acknowledged to <span class='it'>be</span> so;) and the genius is
greater or less, first, as the general mental power is
more or less inordinately great; and, secondly, as
the proportion of the faculties is more or less absolute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An objection will be made:—that the greatest
excess of mental power, however proportionate, does
not seem to satisfy our idea of genius, unless we
have, in addition, sensibility, passion, energy. The
reply is, that the “absolute proportion” spoken of,
when applied to inordinate mental power, gives, as a
result, the appreciation of Beauty and horror of Deformity
which we call sensibility, together with that
intense vitality, which is implied when we speak of
“Energy” or “Passion.”</p>

attraction, of course.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>25.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is by no means clear, as regards the present revolutionary
spirit of Europe, that it is a spirit which
“moveth altogether if it move at all.” In Great
Britain it may be kept quiet for half a century yet, by
placing at the head of affairs an experienced medical
man. He should keep his forefinger constantly on
the pulse of the patient, and exhibit <span class='it'>panem</span> in gentle
doses, with as much <span class='it'>circenses</span> as the stomach can be

<p class='pindent'>When Parisian society had passed the dread ordeal
which bears the name of the Reign of Terror, through
continual scenes of blood and tears, it seemed by a
strange and almost unaccountable impulse to be impelled
to mirth and festivity. On the day after the disappearance
of the guillotine French frivolity resumed
its sway with a thousand whims and vagaries, to
which the stern muse of history would pay no attention,
but to which, in this sketch of the follies of
humanity, we may aptly attend. One of the whimsicalities
peculiar to the day is that in memory of
the sad toilette of the guillotine, when the hair was
cropped by the shears of the executioner, a similar
<span class='it'>coiffure</span> was the <span class='it'>mode</span>. Women laid aside their
luxuriant locks for a <span class='it'>coiffure à la victime</span>, and
wore a band of blood-red velvet around the neck, as
if in derision of the fall of the axe. This fashion,
emanating in France, where recklessness had been
produced by the constant presence of danger, went
the round of the world, and the <span class='it'>coiffure à la victime</span>
was worn by both sexes in quiet neighborhoods,
which had learned only by report of the fearful atrocities
committed in the capital of civilization. Balls
<span class='it'>à la victime</span> also became the vogue, and none were
at first admitted to them except those who had lost
relations on the scaffold. To some of these balls it
was requisite not to have lost collaterals only, but
a parent, or brother, sister, husband or wife. There
were exclusives even there, and a new nobility of
the scaffold was created. This was the era of corsets
<span class='it'>à la justice</span> and bonnets <span class='it'>à la humanité</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Away with care! Bring in the violin and minstrels!
was the cry. A mania for the dance pervaded
all society. High and low, aristocrats and
people, antiques and moderns all danced. The
chapel of the old Carmelite convent became a ballroom,
and the Jesuits’ college a place of festivity, as
did also the convents of <span class='it'>Saint-Sulpice</span> of the <span class='it'>Filles
de Saint-Marie</span>. In the <span class='it'>guinguettes</span> and in the
most elegant society all danced. “If the traces of
crime and degradation were seen every where else,”
says a writer of that age, “a man of taste had at
least the consolation to find in these brilliant assemblages
society not unlike that which made Paris once
the wonder of the world. The winter-balls are the
asylum of good taste, elegance and propriety. In
them a young man may purify himself by the spectacle
of triumphant <span class='sc'>Virtue</span>.” Yet the only requisite
to admission to these balls was a subscription of 96
francs, (about $19.20.) A cotemporary thus describes
one of the most celebrated of these reunions,
that at the Hotel Richelieu, in a manner to make us
skeptical about the virtue. “It is,” says he, “an
arch of <span class='it'>transparent robes</span> of lace, head-dresses of
gold and diamonds. A subscription is required, and
the visiter is ushered into the society of perfumed
goddesses, crowned with flowers, who float about in
Athenian robes, and receive the lisping flattery of
the <span class='it'>incroyables</span>, who prate of their <span class='it'>parole d’honneur</span>.”
It need not be said this is a mere <span class='it'>phase</span> of
Parisian society, fortunately not reflected by the rest
of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ball of the Opera was revived, and to it we
must look for the most striking specimens of costume.
The plain black domino exclusively worn at
such places during the monarchy had disappeared,
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>
and was replaced by a similar garment of the most
striking colors. Turks, Chinese and the old traditional
characters were exiled to the places of popular
amusement, and the great room of the Opera was
filled with Caius Marius, Dentatus, Cicero, Mutius
Scævola, Pericles, Lycurgus, Cymon and Herodotus.
The charm, however, was gone; the new society
had no traditions; the people composing it were
almost ignorant of each other, and the playful badinage
of which the old balls had been the scene was
lost forever. The <span class='it'>Jeunesse Dorée</span>, as the courtiers
of the Directory and Consulate were called, frequented
these balls most faithfully, but the old prestige
was destroyed, and families were not seen as
they had been in the days of old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is strange with what rapidity from the epoch of
the Directory a taste for luxury and pleasure sprung
up in the minds of the people. Music again resumed
its sway, and a hundred places of public amusement
were opened. One of the most significant evidences
that the late or present French Revolution is not yet
over, is the fact that as yet public amusements do
not thrive, and that the people look elsewhere for
excitement than to the stage and concert. The most
curious of all spectacles is the stormy deliberation of
the Assembly, and the artistes of the Executive
power the most attractive of all performers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually a disposition <span class='it'>to make a figure</span> inoculated
society. As the Revolution became distant
luxury increased. Yet it was not the <span class='it'>faste</span> of old
monarchy, but a new splendor, which the persons
left on the surface of society by the <span class='it'>bouleversement</span>
of all orders threw around them. The women in the
lowness of the bosoms of their dresses descended
below even the modesty required by the Regency,
and the <span class='it'>incroyables</span> became more fantastic than the
<span class='it'>marquis</span>. The following was the costume they
adopted, and a more tasteless one can scarcely be
conceived:</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i102.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0004' style='width:450px;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span>
They were not so richly dressed as their predecessors,
nor were they so elegant and graceful, but
their manners were quite as affected. Then came
again the taste for gallant acrostics and love songs,
which caused the poetry of the Cheniers to be forgotten
for <span class='it'>fantasies</span> addressed to the popular actresses.
This prodigality was the more criminal because
it had a contrast in alarming want. The Revolution
did not make France more rich, nor did the
hecatombs slain in defence of the liberty of the country
make the cornfields and vineyards more fruitful.
French prodigality was imitated everywhere, and to
this recklessness may we attribute the fact of the
great increase of the expense of dress in every grade
of society over all the civilized world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mode of wearing the hair for men had long
become fixed; it was cropped and <span class='it'>au naturel</span>, and
has thus remained to our own day. The male costume
became every day more and more inelegant.
Frocks were worn short, loose and broad; pantaloons
loose as a sailor’s lasted to a late day of the empire.
This costume had but one merit, simplicity,
a quality inspection of the following engraving will
show it to have possessed in a great degree.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i104.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0005' style='width:350px;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>All embroidery was abandoned. In 1803 the coat
had taken its definite form, where there is every
prospect that it will remain permanent. It had an
immense collar and was very short before, but it
was yet a coat. Pantaloons were by no means what
they are now, yet still the garment is unchanged.
The hat had become round, and the cravat was
stationary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This brings us to the end of our subject. From the
doublet of Louis XIV. costume has been traced to
our time, and an impartial observer will be satisfied
we have lost nothing by the change; for none who
compare the garments of the <span class='it'>schneiders</span> of our own
era with those of the Latours or Justins of old, will
think good taste has retrograded, or dream of comparing
the bucket-like things which once were worn
<span class='pageno' title='322' id='Page_322'></span>
on the head, with the tasteful and artistic hats of
Oakford. Thus ends this disquisition on dress,
which, believe me, is no trifle; and the evidence of
it is, that nothing more ridiculous can be conceived,
than would be a President, a Senate, or a Supreme
Court <span class='it'>in puris naturalibus</span>.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_12'>THE CAT-BIRD.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Cat-Bird is one of our earliest morning songsters,
beginning generally before break of day, and
hovering from bush to bush with great sprightliness
when there is scarcely light sufficient to distinguish
him. His favorite note is the one from which he
takes his name, and is known to every farmer’s boy
in the United States. It so exactly resembles the
mewing of a kitten as to be invariably taken for it
by the uninitiated; and when a number of these birds
get together it is difficult to resist the impression that
all the feline residents of an entire village are gravely
discussing some important subject. But in addition
to this rather singular tone, the Cat-Bird has a variety
of others, made up, it is true, mostly of imitations,
but blended together with considerable strength and
melody. The Cat-Bird is indeed no mean songster,
and when listened to attentively is capable of at
once pleasing and interesting. He is one of the most
familiar of the feathered race, seeming to have very
little dread of man, and building his nest in every
garden hedge. His confidence is but too often repaid
with death; and notwithstanding his friendly habits
he is persecuted with singular and unrelenting prejudice
by every inmate of the farm-house. It must
be acknowledged that he sometimes revenges himself
by drafts upon the strawberry-beds and cherry-trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cat-Bird is one of the most prolific of the
feathered race, and were he to fly in flocks would
darken the air. He probably winters in Florida,
from whence he reaches Georgia early in March.
In the following month he appears in Pennsylvania.
His nest is generally finished by the beginning of
May. The place is usually a hawthorn fence, a
small tree, briers, brambles or a thick vine. The
female lays four eggs, of a greenish blue color, and
sometimes raises three broods in a season. In affection
and attention to their young the Cat-Bird is unsurpassed.
The cry of man imitating their brood
will frequently throw her apparently into fits; and in
their defence both male and female often risk their
lives. He boldly attacks the black-snake, striking
him on the head with his bill, until the baffled reptile
is glad to withdraw from the coveted nest. It is
rare that the female forsakes her eggs, even after
they have been handled by man. If one or two be
broken she continues to sit upon the others; and if
strange eggs are put in she, with the assistance of
her mate, turns them out. If the nest be removed to
another situation she follows it and continues to sit
as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cat-Bird is nine inches long, of a deep slate
color above, which fades into a lighter tint on the
breast and throat. The legs, bill and tail are black,
with some red about the latter. He is sometimes
domesticated, and in the cage will eat fruit, insects,
bread, cakes, and nearly every kind of vegetable.
He is fond of the water, and, when wild, frequently
<span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span>
dashes through it with great velocity. The species
is said to reach as far north as Kamschatka.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The author of the American Ornithology thus philosophizes
on the ungrounded antipathy against this
harmless and interesting bird:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even those by whom it is entertained, can
scarcely tell you why; only they ‘hate Cat-Birds;’
as some persons tell you they hate Frenchmen, they
hate Dutchmen, etc., expressions that bespeak their
own narrowness of understanding and want of liberality.
Yet, after ruminating over in my own mind
all the probable causes, I think I have at last hit upon
some of them; the principal of which seems to me
to be a certain similarity of taste, and clashing of interest,
between the Cat-Bird and the farmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Cat-Bird is fond of large, ripe garden-strawberries;
so is the farmer, for the good price they
bring in the market; the Cat-Bird loves the best and
richest early cherries; so does the farmer, for they
are sometimes the most profitable of the early fruit;
the Cat-Bird has a particular partiality for the finest,
ripe mellow pears; and these are also particular
favorites with the farmer. But the Cat-Bird has frequently
the advantage of the farmer, by snatching off
the first fruits of these delicious productions; and the
farmer takes revenge by shooting him down with his
gun, as he finds old hats, wind-mills, and scare-crows
are no impediments in his way to these forbidden
fruits; and nothing but this resource—the ultimatum
of farmers as well as kings—can restrain his visits.
The boys are now set to watch the cherry-trees with
the gun; and thus commences a train of prejudices
and antipathies, that commonly continue through
life. Perhaps, too, the common note of the Cat-Bird,
so like the mewing of the animal whose name it
bears, and who itself sustains no small share of prejudice,
the homeliness of its plumage, and even his
familiarity, so proverbially known to beget contempt,
may also contribute to this mean, illiberal and
persecuting prejudice; but with the generous and the
good, the lovers of nature and rural charms, the confidence
which the familiar bird places in man, by
building in his garden, under his eye, the music of
his song, and the interesting playfulness of his manners,
will always be more than a recompense for all
the little stolen morsels he snatches.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_13'>THE CHICADEE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>This bird is also known as the Black-capt Titmouse.
It is an active, hardy animal, abounding in
the Northern and Middle States, Canada, and as far
north as the 60th parallel. It is a familiar and amusing
bird, often making its appearance in our cities in
fall or winter, and approaching near to man, in order
to glean from his bounty or carelessness a supply of
food. During the same seasons large flocks scour
the fields and woods in search of insects, larvæ,
seeds and berries. Kernels containing oil, and the
fat of animals are greedily devoured by them. When
all these fail, they enter barns, sheds, and the roofs
of houses, clearing them of moths, eggs of insects,
spiders and wood-worms. They appear to be very
little affected by extreme cold, being provided with
thick downy feathers, and a constitution naturally
robust. In winter, numbers collect on a snow-bank,
and swallow small pieces, either to slake thirst or
for pleasure. On such occasions, and generally
when collecting food, they keep up a continual chattering,
which renders their places of haunt easy of
discovery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chicadee builds in the hollows of trees, the
nest being constructed of moss, feathers, and similar
soft materials. The eggs are from six to a
dozen in number, white, speckled with red. They
rear two broods in a season. The young are strong
and lively, requiring little assistance from the old
ones, but living with them, as one family, through
the fall and winter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beside the usual chicking note of this bird, from
whence its name, it has a harsh angry tone, to express
anger or fright, and a kind of melancholy wail,
approaching a song. Sometimes its voice is said to
resemble the noise produced by sharpening a saw.
“These birds,” says Wilson, “sometimes fight violently
with each other, and are known to attack
young and sickly birds that are incapable of resistance,
always directing their blows against the skull.
Being in the woods one day, I followed a bird for
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span>
some time, the singularity of whose notes surprised
me. Having shot him from off the top of a very tall
tree, I found it to be the Black-Headed Titmouse,
with a long and deep indentation in the cranium, the
skull having been evidently at some former time
drove in and fractured, but was now perfectly
healed. Whether or not the change of voice could
be owing to this circumstance, I cannot pretend to
decide.” The unnatural practice of destroying their
sick is however denied of these birds by late writers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chicadee is five and a half inches in length,
and six in extent. The whole upper part of the head
and neck is black, and the body a mouse-color. It
has often been confounded with the European Marsh
Titmouse, but there seems good reason to consider
this as an error. The foreign bird is never seen in
flocks, frequents streams or water-courses, and has a
note quite different from that of the Chicadee. It is
also an inch shorter.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reader, do you love old houses, old books, old
pieces of furniture, old chairs, in short, all the relics
of antiquity which fashionable people usually discard
and despise? If so, there is a bond of sympathy between
us, and I shall not be afraid to rake among the
cold ashes of the past for some unconsumed remnant
of other days, even though I find only trifles to reward
my search. The very table on which I write,
black with age, and wearing a polish which nothing
but years and years of manual labor could have given
it, owes its peculiar favor in my eyes to the fact of
its being more than a century old. What stories
could it not tell of days gone by; what reminiscences
of tea-drinkings, and christenings, and weddings, and
funerals must be imbedded in every pore of the old
mahogany!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But for real hearty enjoyment of such a taste for
homely antiquities, commend me to an old-fashioned
secretary, (<span class='it'>that</span> is the true name—<span class='it'>bureau</span> is but a
modern Gallicism,) with its desk, and pigeon-holes,
and secret-drawers, especially if it have been an
heirloom in possession of a maiden aunt, who died a
spinster of seventy-two, or thereabouts. What stores
of relics it contains—locks of hair taken from the
heads of pretty children, whom we only recollect as
wrinkled old bodies that seemed never to have been
young; mourning-rings, with obituary inscriptions
of persons whose existence we should never have
known but for this record of their death; golden
knee-buckles and sparkling paste shoe-buckles, reminding
us of the days when the dress of a gentleman
was hopelessly inimitable to the rowdies and
loafers of the period; fragments of wedding-gowns,
carefully rolled in bits of linen, yellow with age—preserved
in order to impress the next generation
with due respect for some wizened-up, childish old
lady, who was once a belle, and was married in a
dress of silver brocade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps, too, there are more tender memorials
hidden in the secret drawer. Let us touch the spring,
and lo! what trophies of love’s power are there.
Shall we pause to read these verses? The ink is
almost faded out, the paper is falling to pieces in its
folds, and he who wrote, and she who with fluttering
heart first read those tender lines, have long since
been dirt and ashes. Here is a quaint old ring—two
hands clapped together, and within the circle an inscription
in old English characters—the single word,
“<span class='it'>Forever</span>.” She who once wore that ring was an
angel upon earth, and he who placed it there, lived
and died “as the beasts that perish;” will their union
be, indeed, <span class='it'>forever</span>? Look at that bracelet, woven of
soft, silken hair, its golden clasps are dimmed with
age, but the hair still wears its rich sunshiny lustre,
though she who bestowed it as a parting gift to a
sister, has been long a tenant of the tomb. What is
this, folded so carefully and so closely, like one of
the mummied mysteries of the pyramids? A curl, a
thick, dark curl—not the long flowing tress that
might have floated over woman’s graceful neck;
these crisped and glossy tendrils tell of the strength
and beauty of manhood. A faint perfume rises from
the inner folds of the envelope—the ashes of a rose
are there enclosed. And this is all! But what a
tale do these scanty memorials of a by-gone love impart
to the beholder! What matters it that the details
of the story are forgotten? What matters it whether
the lady or her lover were to blame? It was a
love tender and true, but yet unhappy, else wherefore
the curl of raven hair so carefully cherished, and
the dead rose so reverently buried beside the more
life-like memento? The love which brings happiness
becomes diffusive in its expression, and the love-tokens
of the youth and maiden are hidden, in after-days,
beneath the accumulation of affection’s later
offerings. But when one flower becomes the treasure
of a life-time; when one lock of hair is guarded like
the heart’s pearl of price, then be sure that the hallowing
touch of sorrow has been there. It is only
when grief and love go hand in hand, that trifles become
holy relics wherever they tread. Alas! do we
not all wear upon our hearts a reliquary, in which, impearled
with tears, and adorned with the fine gold of
our best affections, we have enshrined some fragment
of the past, whose value we alone can tell?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I am growing sad, serious, and, of course, dull;
yet the object which led me into this train of thought
was certainly not calculated to inspire any especial
exhibition of sentiment. I was rummaging in such
a secretary as I have described, when I accidentally
pulled out a round pincushion, banded with silver
about the middle, and attached to a substantial silver
chain, which terminated in a broad hook, for the purpose
of fastening it to the girdle of some thrifty
housewife. On the heavily-wrought circlet which
made the equinoctial line of the purple velvet globes
which had been doomed to do duty in so humble a
capacity, were the initials “<span class='it'>A. L.</span>,” and I at once
recognized it as the constant appendage of my respected
and venerated relative, Aunt Abby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had just been reading a paragraph respecting the
female clubs in Paris, and the sight of this relic of
old times, reminded me of the fact that poor Aunt
Abbey had lived just half a century too soon, for to
<span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span>
the day of her death the old lady’s favorite topic of
conversation was the “equality of the sexes.” How
would she have rejoiced in the modern attempts to
enfranchise woman from her thraldom! how would
she have gloried in the idea of woman’s equal rights
of property! how would she have delighted in the
prospect of political privileges for her sex! how she
would have expatiated upon the benefits of a female
House of Representatives! Aunt Abby (my <span class='it'>great</span>
aunt, by the by) was emphatically an advocate for
woman’s “<span class='it'>standing alone</span>,” (I believe that is the
phrase among the reformers,) and certainly, though
she had a father, uncles, cousins, to say nothing
of a husband, she succeeded in “<span class='it'>standing alone</span>,”
to a certain extent, all her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what, you will say, had a disciple of progress,
a defender of woman’s rights, a declaimer against
woman’s slavery, to do with a <span class='it'>pincushion</span>? Let me
sketch her portrait at full length, and then you will
see how curiously she blended the duties and prerogatives
of both sexes in her own proper person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abigal, or, as she was usually called, Abby Leyburn,
was the only child of a learned and eccentric
clergyman, who, being disappointed in his hope of
exercising his theories of education on a son, chose
to educate his daughter after the manner of a boy.
Fortunately for him, the little girl possessed a singularly
strong and quick mind. She grasped at knowledge
as most children would at playthings, and imbibed
wisdom with as much zest as others would have
sucked an orange. Latin, Greek and Hebrew, mathematics,
moral philosophy, to say nothing of the
lighter accomplishments of botany, geology, and
natural history, were <span class='it'>among</span> the young lady’s acquirements.
Her father had determined to make her a
second Madame Dacier, and he really seemed likely
to find her a sort of female <span class='it'>Crichton</span>. Nor were
these all her acquisitions. The details of housekeeping,
the thrift, management, and tidiness necessary
to the comfort of American homes, was as easy
as the alphabet to Abby. She could knit, and spin,
and sew; she could bake, and brew, and cook; she
could milk, and churn, and make cheese; and nobody
could so effectually and rapidly “set things to
rights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beside all this, Abby Leyburn, at twenty years of
age, was one of the handsomest girls in the country.
She was like nothing so much as the effigy of Britannia
on an English penny. Don’t laugh, reader,
the comparison is a highly complimentary one, but
lest you should not recollect the stately Mrs. Bull, I
will describe my heroine. Abby was just six feet
high, but magnificently proportioned, a perfect Juno
in form, with large black eyes, a high forehead, full
red lips, and a chin as massive and as despotic in its
expression as Napoleon’s. Her profile was superb—bold,
strongly-marked, but beautifully classical. Her
abundant hair, usually worn back from her brow, and
gathered into a knot at the back of her head, was
black as the crow’s wing. Her teeth were white,
strong, and somewhat pointed in shape, a peculiarity
which rather impaired the softness of her smile, inasmuch
as it was always associated with the beholder’s
remembrance of a somewhat similar conformation
in the dental perfections of the only wild animal who
has ever been accused of laughing—I mean the
hyena. Not that Abby bore the slightest resemblance
to the disagreeable creature just named. But her
smile certainly lacked that indefinable charm which
usually belongs to such pleasant demonstrations of
good humor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a specimen of the human animal Abby was
perfect. The superb proportions of her well-rounded
figure, her complexion, pure, fresh, and radiant with
health, her firm step, quick, active motions, and
great strength of frame, combined to make her a
model of “<span class='it'>le grande <a id='and'></a>et beau physique</span>.” Add to
these personal attractions, her learning, and her domestic
accomplishments, and one might almost fancy
that Aunt Abby, in her younger days at least, came
near being</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“That faultless monster which the world ne’er saw.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What did she lack? you will ask. Certainly not
virtues, for she abounded in them. No; her defects
were of a very different character. She had every
thing that one would consider desirable; but Aunt
Abby lacked “one sweet weakness.” There was
the difficulty. She had no <span class='it'>weaknesses</span>. That magnificent
person of hers was brimful of strong, stubborn
intellect. If she had a heart, it was only a piece
of mechanism, necessary to the workings of the
human machine. The brain—the strong, massive,
abundant brain, which lay behind that immense forehead,
was the only motive power which she acknowledged.
Had she no benevolence, no kindly
impulses, no yearning tenderness of soul, no sentiment?
Not an atom of either; yet she did the most
benevolent things in the world, lavished kindness
upon all who deserved it, was full of gentleness toward
little children, and, if judged by her deeds,
would have seemed overflowing with the milk of
human kindness. But still it was the dictates of that
cold despotic intellect which she obeyed. “People
must be in want, and must be relieved by those who
had means. Humanity was full of suffering—the
healthy must look after the sick. Little children are
incipient men and women, therefore must be taken
care of. Sentiment was but the <span class='it'>penumbra</span>, the
shadow of a shadow as unsubstantial as itself.” Such
were among the apothegms of this singular woman.
Reversing the established axiom, that “there is nothing
in the intellect which does not come by the
senses,” she seemed to assert that “there was nothing
in the senses which did not come by the intellect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Mr. Leyburn held the office of president over
one of the few institutions of learning then in America,
Abby had ample opportunity for displaying her talents
and beauty to the admiring eyes of sundry young
students. But Abby had no personal vanity; she
knew she was handsome, just as she knew she was
strong and robust, and she would have scorned the
idea of being a belle. The young men, although
belonging to that peculiarly inflammable species
known by the name of “College Boys,” would as
<span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span>
soon have thought of falling in love with the stone
image of Minerva on the college-green, as with the
president’s learned daughter. There was something
in her sturdy good sense which everybody rather
liked, yet the want of softness and pliability in her
character excited a certain dread in all who came
near her. Gifted with peculiar powers both of mind
and body, she had no compassion for feebleness of
frame or infirmity of purpose, for she had no clear
perception of such things. Her intellect was like a
telescope through which she could examine the
grand and the remote, but she could not use it as a
microscope to examine the littlenesses of humanity.
It is only through the sympathies of the heart that we
learn respect for the sufferings, or compassion for
the weaknesses of our fellows—and Abby Leyburn
had no sympathies, except those of the brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perfectly self-possessed, because thoroughly conscious
of her own vast superiority, and utterly indifferent
as to the impression she was likely to make,
Abby’s manners in society had all the elegance and
nonchalant ease which fashion tries so hard to teach.
She conversed exceedingly well on all subjects, and
possessed the gift (most rare among talented women)
of making herself as agreeable to her own sex, as to
the men. Everybody admired her, yet everybody
feared her; everybody acknowledged her rare powers,
yet everybody kept at a certain distance. “He
comes too near who comes to be denied,” so says
one of the wits and demi-reps of a past age; but
Abby never suffered any one to reach the confines
of <span class='it'>Love-Land</span>, and, of course, none ever attained to
<span class='it'>Declaration Point</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is difficult to imagine a character like that of
Aunt Abby. A woman without softness, and tenderness,
and sentiment, seems such an anomaly, that
we are tempted to doubt the probability of her possessing
any of the qualities we seek in woman. But
Abby had all the necessary knowledge of womanly
duties, all the considerateness we look for in woman,
all the attention to detail which is a woman’s peculiar
province, and withal was possessed of the most indomitable
good humor. She was sententious, because
every truth became, in her mind, an axiom, to be
stowed away in the smallest possible space; she was
dogmatic, because her opinions were made up by her
own unaided reflection, and were not to be changed
or modified by words. Her self-esteem was prodigious;
it was not the puny vanity which is so often
dignified with such a title, it was rather a magnificent
<span class='it'>Johnsonesque</span> self-appreciation, precisely like that
which looms so grandly beside the vain pettinesses
of the biographer of the great lexicographer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was certainly a great puzzle to every one. A
woman who could quote Longinus, read Homer, expound
a disputed text in the Hebrew Bible, chop
logic with the most caviling acuteness, and talk of
the Differential Calculus as if it were the last new
poem, was certainly something of a wonder; but
when that same woman was seen seated on the
milking-stool, or standing at the churn, or presiding
over a blazing oven, or, broom in hand, raising motes
in the sunbeams by her vigorous attack upon the
“dust of the schools,” or displaying the beauty of
her Juno-like figure, as she paced to and from the
huge spinning-wheel; she was certainly a <span class='it'>world’s</span>
wonder. There is a half-remembered story of Aunt
Abby’s spirit, which no one dares to talk of openly;
but it is believed that a certain gentleman, now high
in civic honors, received, when a youth of twenty,
a severe <span class='it'>caning</span> from the lady, in consequence of
some impertinence, offered when under the influence
of a deep potation. But this may be only a piece of
scandal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The circumstances of Aunt Abby’s marriage were
as peculiar as were her own traits of character.
Among the students of the college was a young gentleman
of large fortune and fine talents, who was
afflicted with a constitutional timidity and nervousness
that paralyzed all his powers. He was the only
child of a widowed mother, who had foolishly resisted
the boy’s wish to go to school. He had therefore
remained at home under the charge of tutors,
and when the death of his mother released him from
her affectionate tyranny, he entered college only to
find himself inferior in attainments to every one else,
and a perfect butt, from his timid shyness. He was
full of poetry and sentiment. Among realities he
was lost and bewildered, but in the world of fancy
he was a hero even to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To a gay set of frolicksome students nothing could
offer better game than the mental and personal peculiarities
of the rich young Southerner, who rejoiced
in the name of Sampson Terricott, (a name soon
transmuted into Sampson Tear-your-coat) by his
companions. Nothing could be more ludicrous than
the association of such a name with such a person.
The redoubtable Sampson was some five feet four
inches in height, with an exceedingly slight figure,
small features of the style usually designated as
“<span class='it'>snub-faced</span>,” with a skim-milk complexion, and
hair of that <span class='it'>sun-burned</span> flaxen color, so common
among hatless country urchins. His voice was a
piping treble, with an occasional tone in it like that
of a cracked penny-trumpet. His hands and feet
were ridiculously small, and when attired in his
college-gown, it required but little caricaturing to
draw his portrait in a style decidedly feminine, yet
decidedly like. He received all kinds of nicknames
for his personal peculiarities, but, perhaps, none
annoyed him more than the <span class='it'>soubriquet</span> of “Miss
Dalilah,” which was generally bestowed upon him.
Yet a mind filled with images of beauty was hidden
beneath this unpromising exterior. He had no force
of character, no iron strength of intellect, but he had
an unbounded imagination, and an unlimited reach
of vision into spiritualities. He was a poet, but
lacking the key to a poet’s harmonies of utterance,
he expended his strength in the beautiful cloud-land
of metaphysics and became a moral philosopher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like all diminutive men Sampson had a decided
partiality for large women. The colossal beauty of
Abby Leyburn had struck him when he first beheld
her, and he loved nothing so well as to contemplate
her from a distance, being quite too timid to address
himself to her. Now there was in Abby a certain
<span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span>
propensity that might almost be called compassion
toward little people. She regarded them as a huge
Newfoundland dog often looks upon a poodle—their
very insignificance and feebleness seemed a claim
upon her protection. It had often been remarked
that Miss Leyburn showed especial favor to those
whom she denominated “the <span class='it'>poor little</span> fellows,” and
no one was surprised, therefore, to find her taking
a great fancy to Sampson Terricott. There was
something so appealing in his manner, such a tacit
acknowledgment of inferiority in his humble demeanor,
such an irresistible claim to tender treatment
in his timid little voice and stammering speech,
that Abby at once took to him as to one of those
“incurables” for whom the world is a hospital, and
every charitable person ought to be a nurse. To the
gentle Sampson the lady became “like the shadow
of a great rock in a weary land.” She overshadowed
him so completely that he could find repose and refreshment
in her presence. Instead of attempting to
be any thing, or do any thing, or say any thing, he
gave himself up to the enjoyment of a consciousness
of perfect insignificance as compared with the
splendid creature, who could excel any and every
body. It was a comfort to see everybody look small
in her presence, but to the nervous student it was a
positive luxury to <span class='it'>feel small</span>, without being mortified
and disgraced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sampson was not in love with his Minerva, he had
no sentiment, no passionate longings for any thing
which the world of reality could afford. His loves
were all idealities, and could not be prisoned in flesh.
But with the same weak fondness that had once tied
him to his mother’s apron-string, he submitted to the
guidance of Abby Leyburn. What were Abby’s
motives for troubling herself with little Sampson no
one knew or cared; but when it was known that she
was soon to become Mrs. Terricott, everybody
thought that the large fortune of the tiny lover would
account for the whole affair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As usual, the world was mistaken. Abby was as
free from all mercenary feelings as she was from all
other frailties. But she had her own notions about
doing good. She saw in Sampson Terricott a highly
imaginative and gifted man, wasting mental power
in immature schemes which his timidity thwarted in
their very outset, and suffering a fine fortune to be
idle in his hands for want of energy to take up his
stewardship. He was weak in health, and subject
to attacks of morbid spirits which sometimes threatened
his reason. In a word, Abby saw that he wanted
some one to take care of him, and she fixed upon
herself as the fittest person. She was now nine-and-twenty,
in the full bloom of health and beauty, and,
as she argued, “if society provides no other resource
for destitute females than marriage, I must marry, or
at my father’s death find myself a beggar.” Having
come to this conclusion, she decided that, as the
giving herself a master was out of the question, and
the idea of possessing a slave in her husband was
equally disagreeable, she had better divide the difference,
and unite herself to one who needed a
stronger nature on which to rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How the courtship was managed no one ever knew.
I am inclined to think there was not much love-making,
and from the kind of dreamy surprise which
Sampson exhibited when questioned about his engagement,
it is presumed he was scarcely conscious
of his own happiness. People said that Miss Leyburn,
reversing the usual order of things, had popped
the question to Sampson, who stammered out, “Yes,”
through sheer fright. The probability is that he did
exactly as she directed him. She gave him to understand
she meant to marry him, and if he offered no
resistance, feeling rather pleased at being relieved
from responsibility for the rest of his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were married in the chapel of the college,
and the half-suppressed glee of the saucy students
may be imagined. All the blank walls about the
college were filled with caricatures, illustrative of
the one idea, “<span class='it'>paired, not matched</span>.” One of these
charcoal libels was particularly annoying, it represented
a nondescript and beautiful winged animal—a
Hippogriff—with the face of a woman, curving her
proud neck beneath a rein held in the hands of
Apollo, while directly beneath was a second representation
of the same magnificent creature tamely
yoked with an ox to the plough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Abby cared little for these things, and she
would not suffer her husband to pay any attention to
them. She made him one of the best wives in the
world, and though she was ten years his elder, and
thrice as big as he, nobody ever believed that he
repented the step he had taken. Their home was at
the South, and, during her husband’s lifetime, Abby
never paid a visit to her early friends. But she was
visited by her family connections, and we younger
members of the circle were often entertained in
childhood by the accounts of Aunt Abby’s splendid
service of gold-plate, her massive silver ewers and
basins in every dressing-room, her Turkey carpets
and rich hangings of Gobelin tapestry, and all the
paraphernalia of great wealth and magnificent tastes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Terricott died, she exhibited her peculiarities
of character still more strikingly. She knew people
had accused her of marrying for money, and she
therefore induced him to make a will, bestowing all
his large property upon his own relatives, with the
exception of a life-annuity of a thousand dollars to
his widow. “I don’t want his money,” she said,
“I took good care of him while he lived, and if he
did not become a great man, it was no fault of mine.
He was rich, and I used his money freely, because
he liked to see fine things and good things around
him; but now I have no occupation here, and so I
shall go back to my old home, and ‘live along.’
I dare say something will be given me to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she buried her poor little Sampson, handed over
his property to the heirs, and with the first instalment
of her annuity in her pocket, came to take up
her abode in ——. But her father had been dead for
many years, and the place was filled with new
people who knew little of her history or of her character.
She soon became disgusted with her new
home, and removing to New York, established herself
there for the rest of her life. In her later years
<span class='pageno' title='329' id='Page_329'></span>
she gave up taking exercise daily, and in consequence
of this she grew immensely large. I have
the faintest shadow of a reminiscence respecting
her personal appearance at that time. I was a
child of perhaps five years old, and had a dear
old aunt, who was as little as a fairy, and almost
as benevolent. This kind little old body once
took me to see our great Aunt Abby; but my
head was crammed full of fairy legends and nursery
tales, and when I saw an immensely large, fat woman
sitting in a chair from which she could not lift
her ponderous form, and met the full stare of her great
black eyes, I thought of the Ogress who always
devoured little children, and immediately set up such
a howl of terror that I was sent away in disgrace.
She died not long afterward, having lived to count
her <span class='it'>ninetieth</span> birthday. Her disinterestedness left her
no fortune to bestow on her relatives, and but for her
profile, (which, cut in black paper, hangs in an attic
room,) her pincushion, and the traditions which remain
in the family respecting her, all trace of her has
vanished from the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Aunt Abby! she used to shock the women of
her time by talking of women’s rights, and was
guilty once of the enormity of wishing to be Pope of
Rome, in order to carry out some scheme for the
advancement of woman’s social position. She talked
of <span class='it'>freedom</span> until some pious prudes really suspected
she meant <span class='it'>license</span>, and she predicted that the time
would come when the genius of woman would rise
superior to the imposed trammels of sex. She should
have lived in the present age, when she would have
seen woman’s struggles for emancipation, as exhibited
in the French female clubs, and the German free
associations, to say nothing of the free inquirers and
declaimers against female slavery in this country.
She should have lived till now to exhibit a rare and
peculiar instance of masculine power submitting
itself cheerfully to feminine duties; and perhaps the
knowledge that Aunt Abby, with all her mental,
moral, and physical perfections, lived and died unloving
and unloved, might go far toward settling the
question of <span class='it'>woman’s rights</span>, and make her quite
satisfied with her easily accorded <span class='it'>privileges</span>.</p>

<p class='line'>Parting! Oh, is it not the bitterness</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Of life, and death? It were small agony</p>
<p class='line'>If we and those we love—heart pressed to heart—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;With loving words, and blended prayers, could die.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>’Tis not the rending of the strings of life</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;That makes death terrible. The mental pain</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>It is not that we fear to close our eyes,</p>

<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Which binds our soul with many a quivering string.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Yes—parting is the bitterness of death—</p>

<p class='line'>We see the cherished of our homes depart,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;As fledglings from the bird-nests flit away.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The cherished ones, whom we have called our own,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And loved so many years, that they have grown</p>
<p class='line'>Into our hearts, and so become a part</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Of all that we have felt, or done, or known.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The ever-present with us, who were wont</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;To greet us every morning, with a smile,—</p>
<p class='line'>To answer to our voices all day long,—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And cheer us with love’s sunlight all the while.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Each hath a separate mission to fulfill,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And when their path diverges from our own,</p>
<p class='line'>And they have said farewell! and turned away</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;From our embrace—oh, then, we are <span class='it'>alone!</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>We miss them in all places, everywhere,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And feel a shadow, and an emptiness</p>
<p class='line'>Forever by our side—but most of all</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;In the departed one’s accustomed place.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>We turn to speak to them—they are not there—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The thought we would have uttered curdles back</p>
<p class='line'>Upon our heart, a stifling agony—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;We turn our tearful gaze along the track</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>By which the dear one went—’tis desolate—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Our home—our heart—our world is desolate—</p>
<p class='line'>In all the places where our joy has been</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Dark shades, and weeping memories, congregate.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>But when our only one—the dearest, best,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The angel of our household, bids good-bye</p>
<p class='line'>And goes forth weeping—then the tortured heart</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Reels with the anguish of the broken tie.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Yes—parting is the bitterness of life—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The agony of death—the ban of earth—</p>
<p class='line'>The inevitable doom—to love—to part—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Is the condition of our human birth.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Thank God! there is a world where loved ones meet</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;In perfect beauty, and unclouded joy,</p>
<p class='line'>Where all is love—where parting never comes</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the courtesy of Mr. J. R. Smith, the artist, we
are permitted to present our readers with another
view of a remarkable place. It is Montgomery’s
House, occupied by General Jackson as his headquarters
at the time of the celebrated Battle of New
Orleans, January 8, 1815. It is surrounded by a
splendid garden and grounds, and a beautiful grove
of cedars, which in this latitude grow to an immense
size. The line of intrenchments running up the
lane by Montgomery’s House back to the cedar
swamp can still be distinctly traced. Farther down
on the banks of the river Mississippi are four live-oak
trees, of immense size, forming a square, and
hanging with Spanish moss. Beneath these trees
the British commander, General Packenham, expired
and was laid out. The spot is a favorite resort of
curious visiters from the city, who go to examine
the battle-ground. Below this is a splendid building,
called the Battle-Ground Sugar Refinery, on the rear
of which is a group of willows, with a mound in the
centre, and surrounded by water. Here are buried
the 2000 British warriors who were slain in the
battle of the 8th of January. A planter’s house near
the spot was occupied, previously to the action, by
General Packenham as his head-quarters. All these
objects form very suitable subjects for the pencils of
our artists; and we are only surprised that they have
not been drawn, engraved and familiarized to the
public long ago.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The search after the philosopher’s stone, after having
vexed the crucibles, and puzzled the brains of alchemists
for ages, is about to be rewarded with success. The New
Eldorado promises wonders as great, and riches as abundant,
as the most vigilant of dreamers could imagine.
The phrase “untold gold” is meaningless now, for nothing
but gold is talked of, and the wealth, which was
significant of immensity, when coupled with “iron
chests,” and “bank vaults,” is sicklied over, and feeble,
when contrasted with the fields of gold which glitter over
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span>
thousands of square miles. The very idea of “10,000 a
year” has become paltry—it is but the cost of a dish of
bean-soup in California—suggestive of utter poverty—the
daily scrapings of the poorest and most indigent digger,
self-sold into slavery at the mines. The man who
owns a square of brick houses is nobody; an empty braggart,
beside him who sits upon golden rocks, with a cigar
in his mouth, overlooking acres of the shining metal. The
very millionaire who used to strut about consequentially,
with his hands thrust into his pockets significantly, may
be hooted now by the veriest sweep in California, as a
vulgar ragamuffin, who would scarce have money enough
to pay his board there on Saturday night, and would be
utterly at the mercy of his landlady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Girard College, as a building, is very well, too, in its
way, as reminding us of an old gentleman who spent half
a century in picking up gold flakes, one at a time, with
his fingers; a plodding, careful old chap, who lacked the
creative faculty altogether, and had no idea of cradles and
basins. His school-house on the Ridge Road will do very
well as a specimen of primitive architecture, and might
answer very well as a sort of outhouse to the palaces that
we <span class='it'>will have</span> in California—a very good stable for the
Master of Hounds to Col. Mason, or some other grandee—but
as it stands, it is <span class='it'>now</span> a shocking evidence of parsimony,
utterly disgraceful to the spirit of the age. A sort of lame
and impotent conclusion to a long life foolishly spent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The far-famed Genoese must have been a dull fellow,
or he would have cast anchor in the Pacific, near San
Francisco, instead of sailing about to no purpose. It is a
wonder, too, how he could have been so stupid, when
there are so many routes to this desirable haven. He certainly
must have been a bad navigator, too, or he would
have got around the Horn, some how, at some time. But
it was reserved for the adventurous sons of Jonathan to
make the successful voyage, and with <span class='it'>the sword</span> to cut the
way to fortune; and instead of diverging like radii from
a common centre, to take the outermost limit, and to claim
as his own all that he walked around and into. Showing
conclusively that instead of bothering one’s brain about getting
on the right side of a question, the safest plan is to
get around it, and capture it by force of arms, as the Irish
policeman did with the mob. It saves a vast deal of hair-splitting,
in argument, and of irrelevant discussion, first
to knock down your man, and then pinion him. Or like the
Cockney sportsman, who winged the farmer’s goose, to say
that you “only came out for the sport, and now that you
have hit the bird, you have no objection to <span class='it'>buy him</span>.”
Jonathan in this case, and in this way, seems to have
bagged the one that laid the golden eggs, which we used
to read of in the nursery, and a whole army of his sons
are now rifling her nest. She must have left behind her
a prolific brood if she satisfies the whole of them. The
veriest “madness of the moon,” must impart a feeble
pulse, compared with the fever which Jonathan’s lucky
hit has created in the whole family. Homeopathy is
totally at fault in this disease. Nothing but very violent
depletion will answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole body of family physicians, and nurses of the
body politic, have their hands full, and the multifarious
practice sets at naught the popular idea of perfection, as
a necessary consequence. It is gratifying to know, however,
that in the absence of consistent and regular treatment,
the popular remedy applied in its early stages is
conducive to longevity and temperance—those who suffer
severely from the fever here, and become exceedingly
dry in consequence, are cured effectually by <span class='sc'>Going
around the Horn</span>. Lying water-logged under the Tropics
being rather a different thing from “getting up a
breeze” at home, and being eminently suggestive of
sobriety of thought, and of taking their cue from facts,
and not from “Q Brandy” continually. Young gentlemen
whose systems were here so relaxed, that nothing
but taking a horn two or three times before dinner could
impart to them sufficient energy to attend to out-of-door
business, go around it, and give it a wide berth in the hot
latitudes—shut their ears to all hints about the nervous
system, and with a hardihood and self command, acquired
within view of sharks and yellow fever, brave danger
without stimulus, and fatigue without “having a gale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the tropics, too, young men, who have at home
found no difficulty in getting three sheets in the wind,
have rather an aerial difficulty in getting a flowing
sail, and with plenty of steam on board, in the absence of
propellers, decline all invitation to steam it, “to drive
dull care away”—the trouble greatest, for the time, being
to get away themselves. The boys who often declared in
the hours of midnight that they were the particular individuals
who feared no noise, and who would not go home
till morning, wish themselves very quietly dozing there,
and are perfectly subdued and indolent under the Equator
in a three days’ calm, and do not insist upon “three
more—and again,” so that they have an opportunity of
candid inquiry and sober reflection, which may be serviceable—promotive
of a thirst for cold water, and an abhorrence
of dark brandy, in a “<span class='it'>sun</span>ny” clime. We do not
see why something cannot be done for Temperance in this
way, as well as not. People talk very disparagingly
about “whipping the devil round the stump,” but so that
the old scoundrel gets soundly thrashed at last, I never
could see that the <span class='it'>modus operandi</span> is so particularly important.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, without pursuing this question, or glancing at the
disappointment of the adventurer—the long days of toil
in unhealthy waters—the burning heat of the sun—the
chilling nights on a dreary soil—the fevers of the mind as
well as of the body—the hope deferred—the horror of being
mixed with such society—the desolation of all good
that he must see around him, mingling with the memory
of the calm delights, the peaceful repose, the joys and
purity of home—the glad eyes of sister or mother left behind,
but now seemingly looking out sadly upon the
scene—the longings for that paradise once more, where in
boyhood he put up a prayer at the parental knee:—Without
speaking of all this, is the reward, reader, worthy of
your sacrifice or of mine, of present comforts and present
friends. I think not. The road to fortune, to honorable
advancement, is open and plainly marked here, and beaten
as it is, with the tread of many feet, it offers far greater
chances of success than all the sparkling sands of California,
mixed as they are with all that is vile and unworthy.
In that immense crowd of adventurers, which is
pouring in from every clime, virtue and goodness will be
but as pearls dropped into the sea—selfishness unmitigated,
vice unabashed, and even red-handed murder, will
rear aloft their hideous forms, overawing all decency, and
setting at naught “all law, all precedent, all right.” The
very absence of all female restraint, their tender charities,
and gentle generosities and affections, and noble self
sacrifices, which knit the bands of society together and
render man human, will there cause to be let loose all the
savage passions and instincts of our natures, and a vast
army of unprincipled men, fierce in the pursuit of wealth,
unrelenting in their towering selfishness as the grave,
will make California a second Pandemonium. What is
all the gold of the earth, in a land of wrong and violence,
and that smells of blood heaven-high, with the whole atmosphere
below tainted with its appalling odor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>No! let <span class='it'>us</span> stay at home, and cultivate habits of industry,
economy and temperance. With a vigilant eye and a
<span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span>
steady step pursue the path which has been marked out
for us to tread through life—never swerving from our duty
to the allurements of pleasure—or by the discouragements
of defeat—but up and on! fearless, determined, brave;
looking all danger manfully in the face; grappling with
all difficulties, if not with the strength, with the determination
of giants to overcome; never growing faint or
weary in well doing—and my life for it, in ten years you
will not exchange places with the proudest aristocrat in
California, whose heart and brain have been seared in the
acquisition of wealth. Above all things, let those of us
who stay behind imitate the self command of the adventurers
who have gone, and go boldly and resolutely
“<span class='sc'>Around the Horn</span>” here, and depend upon it, we shall
find that the true philosopher’s stone—the real Eldorado—the
place where we may truly enjoy the horn of Plenty
and the cup of Peace, <span style='font-size:smaller'>IS AT HOME</span>—<span style='font-size:smaller'>AROUND OUR OWN
HEARTH-STONE</span>—where the light of kind eyes, and the
prayers of warm and true hearts ascend to heaven with
our own, for guidance and protection.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_15'>THE PHILADELPHIA DAILY PRESS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The North American.</span>—The very head and front of
the offending party journals, oracular, dignified, and eminently
solemn. Doctor Bird’s leaders have a stately look
in solid column, and his political articles read as if they
had been subjected to a very patient drill before showing
themselves to the public eye; but his fine genius flashes
out the moment he touches a congenial subject. Of all
American writers we look upon him as the best qualified
to conduct a literary journal, or a monthly review. But,
alas! he is a martyr, who must groan under the daily responsibilities
of a party organ, with a hearty disrelish of its
duties. Why should two such men as Bird and Bryant
be sold into slavery in politics, and be thus comparatively
lost to the lovers of polite literature? “Independent,”
the Washington correspondent of the journal, dashes in
like Saladin, and wo to the Christian who gets a full stroke
of his <a id='sci'></a>scimitar; he is cloven to the chin, or has something
to nurse and to remember. His egotism has been objected
to by those who dislike his slashing style, but that, as much
as his correctness of information, has given his correspondence
character. He is at least fearless in the use of
his weapon, and strikes at high and low with equal
strength and temerity. Hennis gives us once in a while
his touching little essays, conceived in the quiet beauty of
Mr. Chandler’s style—the Gamaliel at whose feet he sat
and learned. For the rest, we do not like the paper. It is
heavy, cautious, and cruelly cold and selfish.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Inquirer.</span>—The model of a daily family paper,
marked by continued and unwearied industry, and beaming
with the kindly nature of its editor. Its ample pages are
crowded with well-chosen selections and active scissoring
of news paragraphs; not, however, always carefully
pruned and clipped down. It is only once in a while that
Mr. Morris shows us that he can write, and his Saturday
Readings are full of the warm impulses and genuine kindness
of the man, but are written more for purposes of good
than to display his powers. Occasionally he warms up
in his general articles, and lets out a spark or two, shows
us a glimpse of the wealth he hoards, and causes us to
wish for continued examples of the ability he possesses.
In his political leaders he sometimes is forced by unfair
opponents into a little causticity at the opening of his
article, but he relents before he gets through, and will
most likely give his “friend” a chance to back out of his
blunder. He has not the heart, though he possesses the
strength, to press his antagonist to the wall, and to pin
him there. Mr. Morris has an agreeable, ready and
devoted coadjutor in Mr. Crump, a man of various
learning and diligent application. This journal is shockingly
“made up,” to our taste, and is all over disfigured
with staring black head-lines, which look to our eye like
the sable of a hearse—its “<span class='it'>postscript</span>” is our particular
horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Daily News.</span>—The absence of Judge Conrad from
the daily press seems to have reinvigorated his powers,
and has given additional force to his pen, and fire to his
thoughts; like an unprisoned eagle, with a spring he darts
to the skies and gazes in the sun. Some of the finest
articles he ever wrote have appeared in the News. Every
subject that Judge Conrad touches, seems to have been
fused, as in a furnace, and the metal flies off in lumps
from his gigantic mind. His intellect illumes and pervades
every part of his subject, and when he drops it, there
is nothing more to be said. His compact, all-grasping
sentences, may furnish subjects for whole leaders to others,
but the vitality has been extracted, and any treatment of
the topic is tame and impotent in contrast. He does not,
however, always seem to know the power of the words
he uses, and will give a whack with his sledge-hammer
with a will at a fly, which would effectually knock down
an ox. Hence he should never write short paragraphs
upon unimportant topics—his style is too ponderous. The
News, as a political sheet, is well managed, barring some
desire, occasionally manifested, to pull, for personal ends,
the strings of its influence; but it is sadly deficient in
mercantile news and facts. At this writing, too, it is
shamefully brought out, and is made up as if the matter
had been sifted over the form, and then locked-up and
printed, and very badly printed at that. Mr. Sanderson
should look to this, for the general editing of his News is
too good to come before the public under so great a disadvantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Public Ledger.</span>—Unquestionably the best penny
paper that has ever been established—showing in all its
appointments the very perfection of mechanical execution,
and in its news collection and collation, sleepless enterprise
and vigilance, as well as persevering ability. Its
leaders are unequal, for the most part written with great
force and adroitness, upon topics familiar or of practical
utility, but occasionally insufferably stupid and dull. On
scientific topics it affects the <span class='it'>ultra</span>-learned. We always
drop the Ledger when it gets upon “oligies.” Mr. Lane,
whose quiet humor occasionally gleams out in his short
editorial articles, like lightning from the edge of a summer
cloud, is unquestionably the <span class='it'>best</span> news man in our daily
press; clear and discriminative, you always find in his
columns all that ought to be said of any and every news
fact, and no more. A nicety of judgment very rarely
attained, and never in our experience so fully, as in the
case of the late Mr. Holden of the Courier.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Sun.</span>—Graced by a good humor that no annoyance
can ruffle, but occasionally inclined to mischief.
Carelessly giving a whack, regardless of consequences,
and forgetting it at the same instant. We regard Mr.
Wallace as a most able man in any paper; enduring, persevering,
and always on the alert. We know of no one
in his department of a newspaper who can for so long a
time continue to perform downright hard, honest good
labor. His nerves and his temper are equally enduring.
He appears to have been born where they sing “Old Virginy
never tire,” and to have lived through life, the music,
the temper, and the sentiment of the song. The topmost
bubble of his heart always sparkles. He is, too, what we
like, a pretty good hater, though with a good deal more
philosophy than is often practiced, in taking his revenges.
With <span class='it'>his</span> editorials, his <span class='sc'>Son</span> makes a capital newspaper,
agreeable, gossipy and gay. The news is filled in with
<span class='pageno' title='333' id='Page_333'></span>
the coolness of an experienced hand, and with the uprightness
and newspaper devotion of his father, he will
one day stand as <span class='it'>high</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Pennsylvanian.</span>—Col. Forney is the best political
editor that his party has ever had in Philadelphia—discerning,
prompt and fearless. He deals, however, too
much in light skirmishing, and pops his enemy off once in
a while from an unsuspected cedar-bush, merely to show
the accuracy of his aim. But he is an able tactician, and
when he <span class='it'>does</span> close fairly, his opponent finds him a tough
and sinewy customer. His articles seem for the most part
to have been dashed off at a heat, and lack the polishing
touch. He often, too, uses a hard word for its sound
where another would be more effective. Occasionally he
sits down in earnest, blocks out his ground, and makes
sore and steady advances; and especially when he has
occasion to defend Mr. Buchanan, his intellect is fully
aroused and on the alert—he then writes with his full
vigor and spirit, and writes well. His partner, Mr.
Hamilton, is one of the most capable business printers that
we know, and every thing in his department is marked
by exactness and proficiency. The press-work of the
Pennsylvanian, on each issue, is what the magazines
would call “a specimen number.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Times.</span>—A jaunty, crotchetty, impudent little
sheet, filled with quibs and quirks, and a sort of laughing
philosophy that shouts over seriousness. Its editor, would,
if he could, go to his own funeral dressed in ribbons, and
wearing a look of rejoicing. He has the happiness of
never seeming for a moment anxious; and you might as
well punch at a wreath of smoke with a foil, as attempt
to interest him in a serious controversy. He will answer
your arguments with a pun, your serious reasoning with
a laugh, and will set ridiculously on end your most carefully
rounded sentence, and go to hacking at its grammar.
Having got you out of humor, he will decline all controversy
with you, if you cannot observe the decencies and
proprieties. So that the man who urges a controversy
with Du Solle, has his anger for his pains, and is fuming
while he is chatting and laughing unconcernedly upon
some other more agreeable topic. Yet the Times has never
given him scope to show the real ability and general information
he possesses. He should be in the Ledger with
Lane, he would settle the “ologies” in short metre.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Bulletin.</span>—Our only evening paper, but managed
with great enterprise and vigor. Mr. Peterson’s strong
Saxon words and nervous style, combined with his various
and correct learning, make the leading articles of this
journal among the ablest that we read anywhere, and have
stamped a high value upon the leading column. There
is a want of editorial tact in its less imposing, but equally
important digest of news and facts. It has all the news,
but it has it in bulk, and looks at times, with its heavy,
solid <a id='non'></a>nonpareil, like a little man covered with black
patches, or as if part of the paper had gone into mourning
for the absence of an itemizer. It is always up, however,
to the full requirements of the public in its telegraphic despatches,
and it <span class='it'>had</span>—what has become of him—the writer
of money articles that was most regarded here. For the
rest, it affects a very nice morality in regard to the theatres,
which we do not like, and do not pretend to understand.
It is too deep for us. It <span class='it'>advertises</span> for the theatres, but
does not <span class='it'>notice</span> them. Are they wrong, or right, or neither?
We suppose there <span class='it'>must</span> be a nice line, which casuists who
examine morals with a microscope have detected.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Dear Graham</span>,—Poor Tom says, “Let not the creaking
of shoes, nor the rustling of silks, betray thy poor
heart to women: keep thy hand out of plackets, and thy
pen from <span class='it'>lenders’ books</span>, and defy the foul fiend.” Without
misconstruing this text more than texts are usually misinterpreted,
I opine, that from those same “<span class='it'>lenders’ books</span>”
of past generations the current literature of our day is
being manufactured. The vast shapes of the Past have
overshadowed the Present, and we are in the umbra of the
eclipse. Pray tell me if there is room left in the whole
length and breadth of the world for an epic, without
trenching upon the preëmption rights of Homer, Virgil,
Dante, Tasso and Milton? Then as regards dramatic
poetry—“ahem! Shakspeare.” Wit and humor? What,
after Chaucer, Rabelais, Ben Jonson, Cervantes, Butler,
Swift, Pope, Sterne, the Spectator writers generally, Fielding
and Smollet? Are there any new Continents to be
discovered? Our own Irving, to be sure, has been cruising
among beautiful summer islands, and returned with a
wondrous store of wealth—jewels and gold tissues, fragrant
gums, Hesperidean apples, painted Salvages, flowers
and odorous spices, to the world unknown before. The
gentle Elia has embroidered incomparable tapestries, and
formed the school of the age. Scott gathers in his mighty
arms the banners of a hundred conquests, and for melodious
versification (after Spenser) Coleridge, Shelley and
Moore, in</p>

<div><h1><a id='new'></a>REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS.</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Salamander: Found amongst the Papers of the late
Ernest Helfenstein. Edited by E. Oakes Smith. Second
Edition. New York: George P. Putnam. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Smith has written nothing so well calculated to
convey to the majority of readers a clear sense of the
richness, originality, and elevation of her genius, as this
wonderful little story. It evinces a high degree of creative
power, being an organic product of the mind, with a
central principle of life, and vital in every part. The
scenery, events and characters have all a living connection
with the leading idea of the work, and illustrate each
other. The form is the ever facile and yielding instrument
of the plastic spirit within, and varies with the variations
in the story and the changes in the thought or feeling expressed.
By a felicity of nature, Mrs. Smith appears
instinctively to subordinate the material to the spiritual;
and thus by making the former simply the symbol by
which she expresses the latter, she spiritualizes matter,
and makes it the living body of the soul. She vivifies and
vitalizes the form until it becomes o’er informed with
spirit. Natural objects as used by the poet, derive all their
effect from being the pictorial language of impassioned
thought, the visible image being but the embodiment to
the eye of the viewless force which penetrates and animates
it; and fitly to employ objects as exponents of
thoughts, a firm, decisive grasp of spiritual realities, of
<span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>
something lying back of all expression, is necessary.
The moment the material predominates over or precedes
the spiritual, it becomes so much dead matter, without
significance, because without life. A great excellence of
the present story is the constant dominion exercised by
the soul over or through its forms of expression, and the
physiognomical character of the style and imagery. When
we thus speak of it as pre-eminently spiritual, we of
course imply that it is thoroughly alive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the wonder of the book, and the quality which will
give it a permanent place in American literature, is the
sure and fine audacity with which it brings the supernaturally
beautiful and the supernaturally terrible into
vital relations with human life, without any shock or jar
of the unnatural to disturb the exquisiteness of the combination;
and this is done in a manner purely original,
awakening no reminiscences of German or English supernaturalism,
and giving unmistakable evidence of being
drawn from the writer’s own life and mental experience.
Indeed, by the very constitution of her mind, Mrs. Smith
seems to see things in their spiritual relations; consequently
she not only looks at things and into things, but
she looks through them, and discerns the supernatural
region from which they proceed and on which they depend.
This vision into a sphere <span class='it'>above</span> sense, is accompanied by
an imagination of sufficient force to shape what she sees
into a form palpable <span class='it'>to</span> sense, and thus to reach the mystical
elements in other minds through their sensuous imagination.
This vision and this faculty are possessed by
all high and powerful natures, and the test of the reality of
the powers is in the originality of the products. Similarity,
even when it does not approach plagiarism, indicates the
intervention of another mind, and by suggesting spectacles
casts ominous conjecture on the soundness or reach of the
eyes. Now the supernatural, as it appears in this volume,
is strictly individual and peculiar, evidencing that the
authoress has herself contemplated, face to face, the
spiritual truths she has embodied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the present story is thus eminently a work of
creative imagination, working in the region of the supernatural,
and ranking “strange combinations out of common
things,” it is at the same time intensely human,
touching at every step on some affection or aspiration of
the human heart, and full of the glee and gloom of our
common life. As every thing is realized to the eye and
imagination, and the vital relation between the natural
feeling and the preternatural agencies is clearly represented,
the reader is conscious of no unharmoniousness in
the general impression left on his mind by the whole
work, but simply feels as though he had been brought
nearer to the life of things, and discerned evil and good in
their spiritual natures. With a power of thought, as
felicitous in its delicacy as in its strength, moral beauty
and moral deformity are both seized in their intrinsic
principles, and embodied in such a manner that the material
form ceases to be the veil and becomes the vehicle
of the nature it encloses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the shaping imagination which this work indicates,
we must add that form or expression of the imaginative
faculty, by which things inexpressible in images are <a id='sug'></a>suggested
by cunning verbal combinations, or which escape
in the peculiar turn of a period, or which are breathed to
the inner ear of the mind in the rhythm of a sentence.
This mystical charm, this elusive, dreamy, ever vanishing
and yet ever appearing grace, gives to the whole work
a character of strangeness almost bewitching, and produces
that fine and faint intoxication of the imagination
which makes it ready to receive and accredit wonders
with as much faith as it commonly awards to possibilities.
It is this quality also which makes it impossible to convey
the moral of the story in any didactic proposition.
It has a profound moral, but it is a moral which refuses to
be comprehended in an ethical axiom, being felt in the
brain and “felt along the heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have been so much engrossed by the merits of this
story that we have little space left to notice some faults.
The notes should not be retained at the bottom of the
page, but should be transferred to an appendix. Occasionally
the imagination of the authoress stutters in its
sublime talk, and gives fragments of gigantic images instead
of wholes. Here and there the philosophic prevails
over the imaginative, and discourse monopolizes a sentence
which should be strictly sacred to representation.
But the sweetness, the tenderness, the beauty, purity and
majesty, with which the work is so replete, hardly allow
even the critical reader to be captious; and to the uncritical,
the absorbing interest of the story would be sufficient
to hide even prominent defects.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Poems. By James F. Fields. Boston: Wm. D. Ticknor
&amp; Co. 1 vol. 16mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Book-writing and book-publishing, according to the
most approved doctrines of the division of labor, are to be
kept strictly apart, and commonly there yawns a natural
gulf between the two, as wide and deep as that which
separated Lazarus and Dives. The present volume,
however, illustrates this seemingly impossible combination,
the author being also one of the publishers, and it
must be confessed that the intellectual and mechanical
execution reflect credit on each other. Mr. Fields has
a mind of great flexibility and fertility, and occasionally
he has compressed within the limit of this volume a large
variety of matter, answering to the mirthful, the pathetic,
the satirical, the tender, and the impassioned. He not
only does not repeat himself, but the work is too small
adequately to express the whole range of his poetic faculty.
The two longest poems in the collection are the “Post of
Honor” and “Commerce,” both of them originally pronounced
before the Boston Mercantile Library Association,
and each including many topics under the general
subject. These evince a keen, shrewd eye for practical
life and character, and the satirical portions are characterized
by a mingled wit and humor unexcelled for general
sharpness. “The Post of Honor” is by far the best, and
its pictures of life, both serious and mirthful, are exceedingly
vivid and true. The versification evinces a complete
mastery of the heroic couplet, in all its ease, energy
and harmony of flow, and it is spangled with fine felicities
of fancy and original verbal combinations. The passages
relating to Lamb and Grey, are replete with a quiet
searching pathos, which touches the inmost nerve of
sensibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many of the shorter poems have already had a wide
circulation through the newspapers. “Fair Wind,” originally
published in “Graham,” and “The Dirge,” we have
seen in the poetical corner of at least a hundred journals.
The new ballads and lyrics, now first published, are
among the best in the whole collection. “The Ballad
of the Tempest,” the “Pair of Antlers,” and “Common
Sense,” are very brilliant and beautiful. “Life at Niagara,”
and the “Alarmed Skipper,” are good specimens
of mirthful poetry as distinguished from versified mirth.
“Children in Exile,” and “A Bridal Melody,” have an
intensity of deep and sweet feeling, which wins its way
into the very core of the heart. We might refer to others
as worthy of notice as these, but we must be content with
quoting one instead of naming many, and we accordingly
present our readers with a most beautiful specimen of
blank verse, addressed to Rogers:</p>

Alphonse de Lamartine. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Lamartine, with many of the high qualities of genius, is
deficient in one of the most important—Common Sense.
He is a fine and eloquent singer of his own idealized and
idolized self, but is gifted with very imperfect powers of
objective perception. He sees nothing as it is, but every
object is more or less a mirror of self. This is equally
true whether the object be Mont Blanc or a Paris mob.
All his descriptions of scenery, though often rising to a
strain of rapturous eloquence and beauty, are never accurate,
even in an elevated poetical signification of accuracy.
Different scenes, in different climes, are all enveloped in
one atmosphere, and all stand for one tyrannizing class of
emotions. Lamartine is a sentimentalist, and no sentimentalist
can celebrate any nature but his own, or consider
the universe as worth any thing in itself. The excellence
of the present volume consists in its subject admitting
of a strictly lyrical treatment, and it accordingly
is full to running over of Lamartine’s strong but narrow
genius, and is resplendent with glittering sentiment and
decorative imagery. The work is not long enough to tire
by its egotism and fine writing, and is closed before admiration
has subsided from the interjection into the yawn of
satisfaction. A nature so rich as Lamartine’s might fill
even a larger book without exhausting its wealth of sentiment
or thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Warren’s works on Law are almost as entertaining

to the young lawyer, and interesting to the general
reader. All who are accustomed to have dealings with
the profession, can obtain from this little volume many
useful and some lucrative hints. The two points on which
Mr. Warren expends his sense and his eloquence are
knavery and incapacity, as those qualities exist among
lawyers. As many lives and more fortunes depend on the
existence of the opposite qualities in the profession, this
volume will be equally valuable if it succeed either in
expelling rogues and dunces from the law, or in enabling
clients to detect them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The author of this little volume has availed himself of
the interest excited by the late disclosures in California,
to construct a story of marvelous adventures in that region.
In regard to probability the work is half way between
Gulliver’s Travels and the Arabian Nights. As
every thing wonderful relating to California is greedily

receive their due attention. They are nearly as much

well adapted for schools and colleges, but for the private

<p class='pindent'>This work has produced a considerable sensation in
England, being a well-written protest against the Church
Establishment, supported by a long array of facts and
arguments. The author was for twenty-two years an
Episcopal clergyman, and was at last forced by his reason
and conscience into his present position. Mr. Noel does
not attack the doctrines of the Church, but its union with
the State, and he attempts to prove that this union is condemned
by the letter and spirit of the Bible, is unjust, inexpedient,
and productive of a host of evils, from which
free churches are exempt.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
